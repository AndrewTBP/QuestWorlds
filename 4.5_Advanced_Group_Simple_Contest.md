## 4.5 Advanced Group Simple Contest

### 4.5.1 Procedure

1. Your GM **frames the contest**.
2. You choose a **tactic**, and figure your PC's **target number** (**TN**) using the **score** of your **ability**, plus or minus **modifiers** the GM may give you. 
3. Your GM determines the **resistance**.  If two PCs contend, your opponent figures their **TN** as described in step 2.
4. For each of your group, roll a D20 to determine your **degree of victory or defeat**, then apply any bumps. Your GM does the same for the **resistance**. Compare your rolled number with your **TN** to see how well you succeeded or failed with your **ability**. Remember to apply any **bumps** from **masteries** or **hero points**.
5. Determine the number of **OPs** scored by the victor in the **contest** from the **group simple contest table**. On a tie the **victory** goes to the **better roll**.
6. Sum the **OPs** gained for each side.
7. The side with the highest number of **OPs** is the victor in the **contest**.

    *1. Determine **degree of victory** based on the difference between the winner and loser's **outcome point** totals on the **group simple contest table**.*
    
    *2. Determine **benefits of victory** or **consequences of defeat**.*

8. Describe the **outcome** based on the agreed **prize**.

#### 4.5.1.1 DEGREE OF VICTORY TABLE

|Difference Between OPs|Winning Group's Degree of Victory|
|:--------------------:|:-------------------------------:|
|1                     |Marginal                         |
|2                     |Minor                            |
|3-4                   |Major                            |
|5+                    |Complete                         |

### 4.5.2 Consequences and Benefits

Depending on which approach seems to grow from the story, your GM may assign **consequences of defeat** or **benefits of victory** from **group simple contests** to the entire group, or to individual members who performed either especially well, or especially poorly. Your GM should default to rewarding or penalizing everyone. Your GM should resort to individualized repercussions or benefits only when a group reward defies dramatic credibility, or when competition within the group is a pivotal dramatic issue.

### 4.5.3 Boosting Outcomes

Because they average together the **outcomes** of multiple participants, **group simple contests** tend to flatten **outcomes**, making **victories** more likely to be **marginal** or **minor** than **major** or **complete**.

To overcome this flattening effect, if the outcome of a **group simple contest** is a **tie** or **victory**, you may spend one or more **hero points** to purchase a **boost**; a **boost** assures a clearer victory.

The cost varies by the number of PCs participating:

* 1 **hero point** for 1-3 PCs.
* 2 **hero points** for 4-6 PCs.
* 3 **hero points** for 7-9 PCs.  
* and so on...

You may spend twice as many **hero points** as required to gain a **double boost**. The points may be spent by any combination of players. They remain spent no matter how the **contest** resolves. You may continue to spend **hero points** to **bump** your individual **result**.

The **boost** increases the collective **victory** level by one step. A **double boost** increases it by two steps.

## 2.4 Augments

You may sometimes face **contests** where more than one **ability** may be applicable to the conflict at hand. In such cases, you may attempt to use one **ability** to give a supporting bonus to the main ability you are using to frame the **contest**. This is called an **augment**. For example, if your character has the **abilities** "The Queen's Intelligencer" and "Master of Disguise", you might use the latter to **augment** the former when infiltrating a rival nation's capitol. Similarly, a character with "Knight Errant" and "My Word is my Bond" **abilities** might use one to **augment** the other when in conflict with a **story obstacle** the character has sworn to overcome.

Abilities that represent special items, weapons, armor, or other noteworthy equipment can be a common source of **augments**. However, this grows tired if over-used and you should try and restrict repeated use equipment used in this way to **contests** where they are particularly interesting or apropos.

**Augments** can also come from other characters' **abilities** if one character uses an **ability** to support another's efforts rather than directly engaging in the **contest**. **Augments** can even come from outside resources like support from a community, see ยง8, or other circumstantial help.

If you have a good idea for an **augment**, propose it to your GM while the **contest** is being framed. When making your proposal, describe how the **augmenting ability** supports the main one in a way that is both *entertaining* and *memorable*. Don't just hunt for mechanical advantage, show your group more about your PC when you **augment**, their attitudes, passions, or lesser known **abilities**. If you are **augmenting** with a **broad ability** like "Fool's Luck", be prepared to describe the unlikely events that tilt the scales in your favor. Your GM will decide whether the **augment** is justified and can refuse boring and uninspired attempts to **augment**, where you are just looking for a bonus to your roll and not adding to the story.

You may only use one of your own **abilities** to **augment** the **ability** you are using in the **contest**, and you may not use an **ability** to **augment** itself. You may not use a **breakout** to augment a **keyword**, or another **breakout** from the same **keyword**. However, **augments** from other players supporting you can add together with your own, along with other **modifiers**, including those from **benefits of victory** and from **plot augments**.

If your GM accepts your **augment** proposal, it will be resolved by one of the methods below. The main **contest** then proceeds as normal, with any bonus from the **augment** added onto the **score** of the **ability** chosen when **framing the contest**. The **augment** remains in effect for the duration of the **contest**.

### 2.4.1 Rolled Augments

To grant an **augment** to yourself, or another PC, in an upcoming **contest**, you engage in a **simple contest** against a **moderate resistance** before the main contest begins to determine whether the **augment** attempt results in an advantage. Frame this **augment contest** with your GM, making it clear how your supporting **ability** will achieve the goal of making your **ability** in the main **contest** more effective. **Augment contests** may not themselves be **augmented**, and if your **augment** attempt ends in **defeat**, you may not make another attempt at an **augment** for the main **contest**. 

If you are victorious in the **augment contest**, your GM will award a bonus of +3 to the **ability** used in the main **contest**. If your description of how you were using the **augmenting ability** was particularly entertaining, your GM may increase the bonus to +6.

If you are using the advanced mechanic for **degrees of victory or defeat**, use the table below to interpret the **outcome** of the **simple contest**. Note that **penalties** for **defeat** when attempting an **augment** are much lessened compared to a regular **contest**.

#### 2.4.1.1 AUGMENT TABLE

|Contest Outcome|Modifier       |
|:-------------:|:-------------:|
|Complete Victory|+M            |
|Major Victory   |+9            |
|Minor Victory   |+6            |
|Marginal Victory|+3            |
|Marginal Defeat |0             |
|Minor Defeat    |0             |
|Major Defeat    |0             |
|Complete Defeat |-3            |

### 2.4.2 Quick Augments

While an **augment contest** before the main **contest** can be dramatic and exciting, it does also slow down the flow of play. An alternative approach, called a **quick augment**, alleviates this by replacing rolling with a bonus equal to one-fifth of the **augmenting score**. If your GM accepts your proposal for an **augment**, simply divide the **augmenting ability score** by five, round down if necessary, and add the modifier as a bonus to your **ability** in the upcoming **contest**.

It is at your GM's discretion whether to roll **augments** or use **quick augments**. Your GM may choose one preferred approach and use it in every instance, or choose one or the other on a case-by-case basis based on interest and flow of play.  

### 2.4.3 Plot Augments

A plot **augment** occurs when your GM decides that your **victory** over a previous **story obstacle** is sufficiently relevant to the **contest** at hand as to warrant a bonus much like a supporting **ability** can. The previous **contest** need not have been immediately prior to the current one, as long as its **outcome** remains relevant. The magnitude of a plot **augment** can be +3, +6, +9, or +M. The more challenging the previous **contest** was and the more relevant that **victory** is to the current challenge, the higher the **augment**.

## 2.3 Rank

Your GM uses a scale known as a **rank** throughout the game. A **rank** represents the scale of a **contest** **outcome** (ยง2.4.6), an **augment** (see ยง2.6), **modifier** (see ยง2.5), **benefits** or **consequences** (see ยง2.8). Your GM also uses the same **rank** as a modifier to a **base resistance** when determining the **resistance's** **TN**.

Bonuses to the dice roll use the scale of values: +5, +10, +15, +M, +M2
Penalties to the dice roll use the scale of values: -5, -10, -15, -M, -M2

So **rank** *one* is +5 or -5, **rank** *two* is +10 or -10, and so on.

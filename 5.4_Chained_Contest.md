## 5.4 Chained Contest

**Chained contests** do not defer **consequences** to the end of the **contest**, instead your GM applies the **consequences** to the loser in the **contest** immediately following a **round**. This leads to a grittier feel to the **contest**, but at the price of a death spiral: once you lose the **consequences** make it likelier that you will lose again. **Chained contests** tend to produce the most extreme **outcomes**, as participants tend to accumulate significant **consequences**.

In a **chained contest** there is no distinction between aggressor and defender, each **round** represents attempts by both parties to overcome their opponent. Your GM should determine who has the initiative to describe what they are doing for any **exchange**, based on their interpretation of the flow of events. If in doubt your GM should defer to you over your opponent to describe what you do in the **round**, and describe the NPC reacting to that.

### 5.4.1 Immediate Consequences

Apply  **consequences** (see §2.6) with immediate effect to the loser, according to the **outcome** of that round. Use the **degree** to assess the **consequences** (see §2.8).

**Chained contests** are asymmetric, in that they accumulate **consequences** for the loser, and not **benefits** for the winner. Your GM may decide to award **benefits** to a victorious PC after the **contest** ends (see §2.6).

After consequences, you decide if you wish to continue the **chained contest** or if you wish to **disengage**, and your GM makes a similar determination for the **resistance**. Both you and your GM then express your intent.

If the **penalties** suffered by one contestant reduce their **ability** below *zero*, they must concede the contest. If it makes sense, your GM may allow you to continue by switching **abilities**. Accumulated **penalties** apply to the new ability used in the contest - this may still force you to concede.

#### 5.4.2 Followers in a Chained Contest

**Followers** may augment your character in a **chained contest**.

In addition, if you suffer a defeat in a round of a **chained contest** you may transfer that **outcome** to a follower. Doing so takes that **follower** out of further rounds of the **chained contest**.

### 5.4.3 Group Chained Contest Outcomes

In a **group chained contest** the side that has not conceded gains the **prize**.

Individual **consequences** or **benefits** will have already been determined by the **chained contest** **outcomes** on each **round**.

### 5.4.4 Parting Shot

The **parting shot** is another simple contest against your **defeated** opponent. The **ability** you use must relate to the consequences the opposition will suffer, but needn’t be the same one you used to win the **contest**. If the loser is a PC they use a suitable **ability** to resist; otherwise the GM rolls a suitable **resistance** value.

If you succeed in your **parting shot** roll, you inflict additional immediate **immediate** against your opponent, worsening their defeat.

However, if your opponent succeeds, they use the **benefits** they would accrue on a **victory**, and subtract them from the number of **consequences** scored against them. If this returns their **TN** above *zero* they may re-enter the **contest**. Your GM describes this as a dramatic turnaround, in which your overreaching has somehow granted them an advantage allowing them to recover from their previous misfortune.

### 5.3.6 Assists

You may either **augment** a teammate to improve their **TN** or 'heal' some of their existing **consequences** (see §2.8.3).

### 5.3.7  Joining an In-Progress Contest

Any **consequences** that you have in effect, or participants in the in-progress **contest** you are joining have, remain in effect.

3. Your GM determines the **resistance**.  If two PCs contend, your opponent figures their **TN** as described in step 2.
4. You roll a D20 vs your relevant **ability**, while your GM rolls a D20 vs the **resistance**.
5. Your GM compares the difference **successes** between the two rolls to assesses the **outcome** (see ยง2.4.6).
6. Your GM then narrates the **outcome** of the conflict as appropriate and assesses any **benefits** or **consequences** that arose (see ยง2.8).
7. Award **experience points** if appropriate (see ยง8.1).

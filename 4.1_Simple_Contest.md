## 4.1 Simple Contest

### 4.1.1 Procedure

1. Your GM **frames the contest**.
2. You choose a **tactic**, and figure your PC's **target number** (**TN**) using the **score** and any **modifiers**. The PCs **TN** is the **score** of their **ability**, plus or minus **modifiers** the GM may give you.
3. Your GM determines the **resistance**.  If two PCs contend, your opponent figures their **TN** as described in step 2.
4. Roll a D20 to determine your **success or failure**, then apply any **bumps** from **masteries** or **story points**. Your GM does the same for the **resistance**.
5. Determine **victory** or **defeat**. Award **experience points** if appropriate (see ยง8.1).
6. Describe the **outcome** based on the **story obstacle**.

## 7.1 Gaining Experience

During a session of play your character will have the chance to learn from experience or overcoming personal obstacles. When your character learns, they gain a **HP**. At the end of the session **HP** that were not **burned** on a **bump** or a **plot edit** become **XP** and are added to your **XP Pool**.

### 7.1.1 Earning Hero Points

You gain an **HP** for any of the following:

* When your **result** for using an ability is a **failure** in a **simple contest**. You only gain an **HP** the first time your **result** is a **failure** to use that ability in a session; repeated **failures** to use the same ability teach you nothing else and you gain no further **HP** for that **ability** until the next session. You do not learn from a **fumble** and so you do not gain an **HP** when you **fumble**. If you **bump** your **result**, either through burning a **hero point** or a **mastery**, you do not gain an **HP** for that **contest**.
* When you suffer a **defeat** in a **long contest**. You do not gain any **HPs** for a **failure** on an **exchange** in a **long contest**, only if you suffer a **defeat** in the **long contest**. You do not gain any **HPs** for a defeat in a **long contest** in which you burned **HPs** or used a **mastery** to **bump** your **result** in any **exchange**.
* You gain an **XP** when your GM uses any of your **abilities** in a contest with you. This happens when the story forced you to confront a **flaw**, although your GM might use any **ability** this way, if the circumstances fit (see ยง3.4). If you accept acting according to your **flaw**, or the behavior proposed by the GM for that **ability**, you still gain the **HP**. You can only gain a **HP** from an individual **ability** being used against you once per session. Repeated confrontations with the same **flaw** or **ability** in the same session do not teach you anything else.

You do NOT gain **HPs** from an **Assured Contest**, even if you roll to determine **benefits** or **consequences**. **Flaws** or **abilities** used as the **resistance** are an exception to this (see above).

You can gain a maximum of five **hero points** in any one session. Once you have earned five **hero points**, including ones that were burned in a session, you cannot gain further **hero points** in that session. You should usually expect to earn less, and may earn none.

Note that if you have a **mastery** in your **ability**, you will need to contend against a **resistance** that also has a **mastery** to learn by a **failure**. When **masteries** 'cancel out', you can once again roll a **failure** result giving you the opportunity to learn. You may also choose to use **abilities** that do not have a **mastery** even if an **ability** with a **mastery** could apply, as **failure** with them will lead to your gaining a **hero point**.
 
As your **ability** ratings improve, you will gain fewer **HPs**, and thus be able to **bump** less often, and improve your **abilities** less frequently, unless you take on greater challenges. This is by design. Your GM should craft stories that provide greater challenges to experienced PCs to allow them the opportunity to earn **HPs**. Burning an **HP** to gain a **bump** prevents you from gaining a **HP** from that **contest**. Sometimes you may need to trade-off between a **defeat** from which you can learn, and a **victory** which brings you closer to your goal.

### 7.1.2 Gaining Experience Points

At the end of a session of play, any **HP** that you have not **burned** become **XP** on a one-for-one basis. Your **HP** reset to zero at the beginning of the next session of play.

You accumulate **XP** in your **XP Pool** between sessions. You can use them to purchase an **improvement package** (see ยง7.2) at which point spent **XP** are subtracted from the pool.

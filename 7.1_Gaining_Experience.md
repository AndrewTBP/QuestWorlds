## 7.1 Gaining Experience

During a session of play your character will have the chance to learn from experience or overcoming personal obstacles. When your character learns, they gain a **hero points**. At the end of the session **hero points** that were not **burned** on a **bump** or a **plot edit** become **experience points** and are added to your **experience point pool**.

### 7.1.1 Earning Hero Points

You gain one **hero points** for any of the following:

* When your **result** for using an ability is a **failure** in a **simple contest**. You only gain one **hero point** the first time your **result** is a **failure** to use that ability in a session; repeated **failures** to use the same ability teach you nothing else and you gain no further **hero points** for that **ability** until the next session. You do not learn from a **fumble** and so you do not gain a **hero points** when you **fumble**. If you **bump** your **result**, either through burning a **hero point** or a **mastery**, you do not gain a **hero point** for that **contest**.
* When you suffer a **defeat** in a **long contest**. You do not gain any **hero points** for a **failure** on an **exchange** in a **long contest**, only if you suffer a **defeat** in the **long contest**. You do not gain any **hero points** for a defeat in a **long contest** in which you burned **hero points** or used a **mastery** to **bump** your **result** in any **exchange**.
* You gain a **hero point** when your GM uses any of your **abilities** in a contest with you. This happens when the story forced you to confront a **flaw**, although your GM might use any **ability** this way, if the circumstances fit (see ยง3.4). If you accept acting according to your **flaw**, or the behavior proposed by the GM for that **ability**, you still gain the **hero point**. You can only gain a **hero point** from an individual **ability** being used against you once per session. Repeated confrontations with the same **flaw** or **ability** in the same session do not teach you anything else.

You do NOT gain **hero points** from an **Assured Contest**, even if you roll to determine **benefits** or **consequences**. **Flaws** or **abilities** used as the **resistance** are an exception to this (see above).

You can gain a maximum of five **hero points** in any one session. Once you have earned five **hero points**, including ones that were burned in a session, you cannot gain further **hero points** in that session. You should usually expect to earn less, and may earn none.

Note that if you have a **mastery** in your **ability**, you will need to contend against a **resistance** that also has a **mastery** to learn by a **failure**. When **masteries** 'cancel out', you can once again roll a **failure** result giving you the opportunity to learn. You may also choose to use **abilities** that do not have a **mastery** even if an **ability** with a **mastery** could apply, as **failure** with them will lead to your gaining a **hero point**.
 
As your **ability** ratings improve, you will gain fewer **hero points**, and thus be able to **bump** less often, and improve your **abilities** less frequently, unless you take on greater challenges. This is by design. Your GM should craft stories that provide greater challenges to experienced PCs to allow them the opportunity to earn **hero points**. Burning a **hero point** to gain a **bump** prevents you from gaining a **hero point** from that **contest**. Sometimes you may need to trade-off between a **defeat** from which you can learn, and a **victory** which brings you closer to your goal.

### 7.1.2 Gaining Experience Points

At the end of a session of play, any **hero points** that you have not **burned** become **experience points** on a one-for-one basis. Your **hero points** reset to zero at the beginning of the next session of play.

You accumulate **experience points** in your **experience point pool** between sessions. You can use them to purchase an **improvement package** (see ยง7.2) at which point spent **experience points** are subtracted from the pool.

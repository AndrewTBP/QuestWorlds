# 8. Long Contests

Most conflicts should be resolved simply and quickly, using the simple contest rules.

However, every so often, you’ll want to stretch out a resolution, breaking it down into a series of
smaller actions, increasing the suspense the players feel as they wait to see if they succeed or fail.

Think of the different ways a film director can choose to portray a given moment, depending
on how important it is to the story, and how invested he wants us to feel in its outcome.
For example, there are two ways to shoot a scene in which a thief cracks a safe.

The action can be portrayed quickly, perhaps with a moment where the actor catches his
breath to see if the tumblers fall into place, and a brief swell of music on the soundtrack. Then he sighs with relief, opens the safe, and gets whatever is inside. Directors choose to dispense with such actions relatively quickly when they’re tangential to the main point of the story. In this instance, the story is about what happens after the thief gets what’s in the safe, not about what might happen to him if he fails.

Another film might instead choose to make the opening of the safe provides either a pivotal
turning point in the story, if not its climactic moment. It would spend many scenes building up to the
safe-cracking sequence: introducing the team of thieves, underlining the difficulty of the attempt, and making us care what happens if the safe isn’t opened. Unlike the above example, this is a movie about a bunch of guys who set out to crack a safe. Naturally, then, it would be a huge disappointment to the audience, after all of that build-up, if the director quickly and anticlimactically allowed the lead character to succeed or fail in a few short moments. Instead he breaks the attempt into a series of obstacles. There is an ebb and flow to the action, as film techniques manipulate our sense of tension. The pace of editing often increases. The pulse of the music tightens its subliminal grip on us. First the hero seems to be succeeding, then failing, then maybe succeeding, and then failing again… until the moment when final triumph is won—or disaster ensues.

Even a movie driven by action and suspense will typically include only a handful of these set-piece
sequences. They need the rest of their running times to build up to their big moments, to make
us care about the characters, and to give us quiet moments to contrast with the white-knuckle parts.

Set-piece moments of action, suspense or heightened drama, are resolved in one of two ways:
scored contests, and extended contests. These two contests types allow you to focus on important
sequences, drawing them the suspense surrounding their outcomes. They can be exciting when
employed sparingly, but lose their luster when overused. Most groups will find that the typical four hour session should contain at most one or two group scored contests. 

Don’t throw them in gratuitously, even if it means that entire sessions go by without any long contests.There is no action that is always by definition important. You may be tempted, for example, to adjudicate every fight with an extended or scored contest, because fights seem like they should take a while and focus the players’ attention. Doing this will dilute the impact of all of your fight scenes. Think of your favorite action movie. Fights with main villains and their featured sidekicks are fully dramatized, with an ebb and flow of suspense as the relative advantage flows back and forth
between the two sides. But anonymous guards and bad guys are dispensed with in seconds, because
conflict with them is not what the scene at hand is about.

Always know why you’re using one of the pivotal scene contest methods. If you can’t
articulate to yourself why this is a pivotal scene in the current session, use simple contests instead.

If the stakes don’t matter much, use simple contests instead.

If the players aren’t emotionally invested in a situation, think about using a simple contest. Maybe you didn’t lay enough groundwork, and need to go back and insert story development scenes
in which they come to understand why this matters. Then come back to it and run it as a long contest.
Possibly the players have a different idea of what the story is about than you do, and you need to
follow their lead. Find out what they care about, make the stakes of the drama revolve around that,
and use one of the two long contest mechanics to drive that sequence instead.

## 8.1 Scored Contest

### 8.1.1 Procedure

1. Your GM frames the contest.
2. You choose a tactic, and figure your PC's target number (TN) using the ability rating and any modifiers. The PCs TN is the rating of their ability, plus or minus modifiers the GM may give you.
3. Your GM determines the resistance. If two PCs contend, your opponent figures their TN as described in step 2.
4. Carry out one or more rounds, repeating as necessary.
    1. An Scored Contest unfolds as a series of simple contests. At the end of each simple contest, the winner scores a number of resolution points (RPs) to their tally, which varies between 1 and 5, depending on the result. Tied results leave the score unchanged.
    2. The number of resolution points the winner garners at the end of each exchange depends on the degree of victory they scored. They get 1 point for a marginal victory, 2 for a minor victory, 3 for a major victory, and 5 for a complete victory. 
    3. The first to accumulate a total of 5 points wins; their opponent is knocked out of the contest and loses the prize.
5. Determine Degree of Success based on Rising Action of Climax (below).
6. Determine Benefits of Victory or Consequences of Defeat. 
7. Describe the result based on the story obstacle.

### 8.1.2 Rising Action 

Rising action refers to all of the many plot events and complications that occur between the beginning and the climax of a story. During this phase of your GM's story, they will use the Rising Action Consequence table to assess results.

Find the difference between you and your opponent's resolution point scores at the contest’s conclusion. Your GM then determines your outcome by cross-referencing with the following table to find the benefits of victory or consequences of defeat.

### RISING ACTION CONTEST RESULTS TABLE

|Difference Between Results|Negative Consequences for Loser|Negative Consequences for Winner|Victory/Defeat Level|
|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:| 
|1|Hurt|Hurt|Marginal|
|2|Hurt|Unharmed|Marginal|
|3|Impaired|Unharmed|Minor|
|4|Impaired|Unharmed|Minor|
|5|Injured|Unharmed|Major|
|6|Injured|Unharmed|Major|
|7|Dying|Unharmed|Complete|
|8|Dead|Unharmed|Complete|
|9|Dead|Unharmed|Complete|

### 8.1.3 Climax

For the final, climactic confrontation that wraps up your GM's story, your GM uses the following, more punishing method of doling out consequences. This represents that at the climax you may triumph, but be laid low by the effort.

Adds up all resolution points scored against you by your opponents. If you engage more than one opponent, be sure to add the resolution points scored against you by all of them. If you lost, add 1 to your total. Your GM cross-references the result against the Climactic Consequence table.

To determine the winning side’s victory level for a climactic scene, if there is only one opponent, use their consequence of defeat. If there is more than one, use the second-worst consequence among the defeated opponents. 

### CLIMACTIC CONSEQUENCE TABLE

|Total Resolution Points Scored Against PC|Consequence|
|:-------------:|:-------------:|
|0|Unharmed|
|1|Dazed|
|2|Hurt|
|3|Hurt|
|4|Impaired|
|5|Impaired|
|6|Injured|
|7|Injured|
|8|Dying|
|9|Dead|

### CLIMACTIC SCENE VICTORY LEVEL TABLE

|Consequence|Victory Level|
|:-------------:|:-------------:|
|Hurt|Marginal|
|Impaired|Minor|
|Injured|Major|
|Dead or Dying|Hurt|

### 8.1.4 Parting Shot

In the round immediately after you take an opponent out of the contest, you may attempt to increase the severity of the consequences your opponent suffers by engaging in a parting shot. This is an attempt (metaphoric or otherwise) to kick your opponent while he’s down:

• Striking an incapacitated enemy
• Attacking a retreating army
• Attaching one more punitive rider to a legal settlement
• Demanding additional money from a business partner
• Delivering one last humiliating insult

Your GM should not use a Parting Shot.

If you succeed in your parting shot roll, you add the result from your roll to the final number of Resolution Points scored against your opponent in the exchange that removed them from the contest.

However, if your opponent succeeds, they take the number of Resolution Points they would, in a standard exchange, score against you, and instead subtracts them from the number of Resolution Points scored against them in the exchange that removed them from the contest. If the revised total is now less than 5, they returns to the contest, and may re-engage you. Your Game Master describes this as a dramatic turnaround, in which your overreaching has somehow granted them an advantage allowing them to recover from their previous misfortune. The provisional consequences they suffered now go away, and are treated as a momentary or seeming disadvantage.

The ability you use must relate to the consequences the opposition will suffer, but needn’t be the same one you used to win the contest. If the loser is a PC they use a suitable ability to resist; otherwise the GM rolls a suitable resistance value.

Where it makes sense, unengaged PCs may attempt parting shots against opponents taken out of the contest by someone else. You may not revive your teammates by using your lamest abilities to make parting shots on them; this, by definition, does not pass a credibility test.

### 8.1.5 Asymmetrical Exchanges

You may choose to briefly suspend your attempt to best your opponent in an Scored Contest, in order to do something else. An instance where you are trying to do something else and your opponent is trying to win the contest is called an asymmetrical exchange. 

In an asymmetrical exchange, you do not score points against your opponent if you win the exchange. Instead, you succeed at whatever else you were doing. You still loses points if you fails. Often you will be using an ability other than the one you've been waging the contest with, one better suited to the task at hand. This becomes additionally dangerous when the rating associated with your substitute ability is significantly lower than the one used for the rest of the contest.

In addition to secondary objectives, as in the above example, you may engage in asymmetrical exchanges to grant augments (see above) to yourself or others. 

### 8.1.6 Disengaging

You can always abandon a contest, but, in addition to failing at the story obstacle, you may also suffer negative consequences. In a contest where your opponent intends to harm you, you will always suffer negative consequences if you withdraw, unless you successfully disengage.

To disengage, you make an asymmetrical exchange, using the ability relevant to the contest you’re trying to wriggle out of. 

If you fail, your effort is wasted and the score against you increases, as it would have during a normal exchange. If you succeed, they escape the clutches, literal or metaphorical, of your opponent, without further harm from a contest during the rising action. In a climactic scene, however, RPs scored during contests you disengaged from are still taken into account when determining consequences. In the case of a group contest, consequences against you are determined as soon as you disengage.

### 8.1.7 What Scores Represent

Your Resolution Point score, tells you how well you’re doing, relative to your opponent, in
the ebb and flow of a fluid, suspenseful conflict. If you’re leading your opponent by 4–0, you’re giving him a thorough pasting. 

If you’re behind 0–4, you’re on your last legs, while your opponent has had an easy time of it. If you’re tied, you’ve each been getting in some good licks.

In a fight, scoring 1 point might mean that you hit your opponent with a grazing blow, or
knocked him into an awkward position.

Scoring 2 points might mean a solid hit, most likely with bone-crunching sound effects.

A 3-point hit sends him reeling, and, depending on the realism level of the genre, may be
accompanied by a spray of blood.

However, the exact physical harm you’ve dished out to him remains unclear until the
contest’s end. When that happens, the real effects of your various victories becomes suddenly
apparent. Perhaps he staggers, merely dazed, up against a wall. Maybe he falls over dead.

In a debate, a 1-point success might occasion mild head-nodding from spectators, or a frown
on your opponent’s face.

2 points would occasion mild applause from onlookers, or send a flush to your opponent’s
face.

On a 3-point result, your opponent might be thrown completely off-track, as audience
members wince at the force of your devastating verbal jab.

In interpreting the results of individual simple contests within a scored contest, Narrators are
guided by two principles:

1. No consequence is certain until the entire scored contest is over.
2. When a character scores points, it can reflect any positive change in fortunes, not just the
most obvious one.

## 8.2 Group Scored Contest
Group Scored contests proceed as a series of Scored Contests between pairs of PC and opponents, interwoven so that they happen nearly simultaneously.

As in an Scored Contest between a single PC and an opponent, only one exchange per pair of adversaries occurs each round. Usually the PCs make up one team, and their antagonists the other.

### 8.2.1 Procedure
1. Your GM frames the contest.
2. You choose a tactic, and figure your PC's target number (TN) using the ability rating and any modifiers. The PCs TN is the rating of their ability, plus or minus modifiers the GM may give you.
3. The GM determines the resistance. If two PCs contend, your opponent figures their TN as described in step 2.
4. The PCs to choose their opponents in order of their TN where it makes sense. Otherwise your GM will allocate opponents to you dependent on what makes narrative sense.
5. Establish an order of the paired contests. There is no significant advantage to going first, but use your group's TNs from highest to lowest if no other option presents itself
6. For each pairing your GM carries out one round. Then they repeat by carrying out more rounds in order, as necessary. The Group Scored Contest ends as soon as there are no active participants on one side of the conflict. The side with one or more participants left standing wins.
    1. An Scored Contest unfolds as a series of simple contests. At the end of each simple contest, the winner scores a number of resolution points (RPs) to their tally, which varies between 1 and 5, depending on the result. Tied results leave the score unchanged.
    2. The number of resolution points the winner garners at the end of each exchange depends on the degree of victory they scored. They get 1 point for a marginal victory, 2 for a minor victory, 3 for a major victory, and 5 for a complete victory. 
    3. The first to accumulate a total of 5 points wins; their opponent is knocked out of the contest and loses the prize.
        1. As one of a pair is eliminated from the group contest, their victorious opponents may then move on to engage new targets, starting new contests, which are then added to the end of the existing sequence.
        2. If participating in multiple pairings, each pairing is the first to 5 points, points already scored do not count. But the accumulated points do count when determining consequences in the Climatic phase.
5. Determine Degree of Success based on Rising Action of Climax (above).
6. Determine Benefits of Victory or Consequences of Defeat. 
7. Describe the result based on the story obstacle.

### 8.2.2 Unrelated Actions

If you are not currently enmeshed in an exchange, either after a successful disengagement, or after winning an exchange, you may take actions within the scene that do not directly contribute to the defeat of the other side. These unrelated actions may grant an augment to yourself or to a teammate. You may achieve a secondary story objective. This resembles an asymmetrical exchanges, except that; as you are not targeted by any opponents, there is no additional risk.

### 8.2.3 Assists

You may take an unrelated action to grant an assist to a teammate enmeshed in an exchange. Assists are subject to the same restrictions as augments: they must be both credible and interesting.

Your first assist faces a Moderate Difficulty. Each subsequent assist attempt to the same beneficiary, steps up by one factor on the table: high, then very high, then nearly impossible. The difficulty escalation occurs even when another PC steps in to make a subsequent assist. This escalation allows the occasional dramatic rescue but makes it difficult for players to prolong losing battles to excruciating length. Your GM should make it seem credible by justifying the increasing difficulties with descriptions of ever-escalating countermeasures on the part of the opposition.

Your GM may adjust the starting difficulty up or down by one step to account for campaign credibility or other dramatic factors. If an assist as proposed seems too improbable or insufficiently useful, your GM should collaborate with you to propose alternate suggestions which would face Moderate Difficulty.

The assist alters the score against your teammate according to the result of a simple contest

### ASSIST RESULTS TABLE

|Contest Outcome|Change to Score Against Recipient|
|:-------------:|:-------------:|
|Complete Victory|-4|
|Major Victory|-3|
|Minor Victory|-2|
|Marginal Victory|-1|
|Marginal Defeat|0|
|Minor Defeat|+1|
|Major Defeat|+2|
|Complete Defeat|+3|

Scores in exchanges can never be reduced below 0.

### 8.2.4 Followers
You may choose to have your followers take part in Group Scored Contests in one of three ways: as full contestants, as secondary contestants, or as supporters.

**Contestant**: The follower takes part in the contest as any other PC would. You roll for your followers as you would their main characters. However, your followers are removed from the contest whenever 3 Resolution Points are scored against them in a given exchange. An additional 2 Resolution Points are then scored against them, increasing the severity of any consequences they suffer.

**Secondary contestant**: To act as a secondary contestant, your follower must have an ability relevant to the contest. The follower sticks by your side, contributing directly to the effort: fighting in a battle, tossing in arguments in a legal dispute, acting as the ship’s navigator, or whatever. Although you describe this, you do not roll for the follower. Instead, their efforts benefit you in two ways:

* When confronted by multiple opponents, you may ignore the multiple opponent penalty for one foe for each follower acting as a secondary contestant.
* You may, at any point, shift any number of Resolution Points to a follower acting as a secondary contestant. Followers with 3 or more points lodged against them are removed from the scene. When a follower is removed from the scene, an additional 2 Resolution Points are lodged against them, increasing the severity of consequences they suffer. You lose the protection against multiple opponents afforded by the follower.

**Supporter**: Your follower is present in the scene, but does not directly engage your opponents. Instead they may perform assists and other unrelated actions.

Followers acting in any of these three capacities may be removed from the contest by otherwise unengaged opponents. To remove a follower from a scene, an opponent engages your follower in a simple contest. Your GM sets the resistance, or if it is another PC's follower they determines the relevant ability of the follower engaging yours. On any failure, your follower is taken out of the contest. For consequence determination purposes, the follower has X+2 Resolution Points lodged against him, where X is the usual number levied by the Resolution Point table.

### 8.2.5 Risky Gambits

During an Scored Contest, you can attempt to force a conflict to an early resolution by making a risky gambit. If you win the exchange, you lodge an additional 1 Resolution Point against your opponent. However, if you lose the exchange, your opponent lodges an additional 2 Resolution Points against you.

If both contestants engage in a risky gambit, the winner lodges an additional 2 Resolution Points against the loser.

### 8.2.6 Defensive Responses

In a Scored Contest, you can make a defensive response, lowering the number of Resolution Points lodged against you in an exchange. If you win the exchange, the number of Resolution Points you lodge against your opponent decreases by 1. If you lose, your opponent lodges 2 fewer Resolution Points against you. The total number of Resolution Points assigned by an exchange is never less than 0; there is no such thing as a negative Resolution Point.

### 8.2.7 Joining Scored Contests In Progress

When you wish to join an Scored Contest in progress, you and your GM should discuss whether you accept the current framing. If so, you can participate. In an Scored Contest, you simply select an opponent and enters into a new exchange. If you want to achieve something other than the goal established during framing, you may instead perform unrelated actions, including assists and augments.

## 8.3 Extended Contest

### 8.3.1 Procedure

1. Your GM frames the contest.
2. You choose a tactic, and figure your PC's target number (TN) using the ability rating and any modifiers. The PCs TN is the rating of their ability, plus or minus modifiers the GM may give you. Figure your starting Advantage Point (AP) total using the TN, including all modifiers and augments. The AP include +20 for each level of mastery, and can also be increased by followers.
3. The GM determines the resistance. The GM opposes the PC with a resistance—the harder the task or tougher the opponent, the higher the resistance. The Narrator figures starting APs for the opposition/resistance from the resistance TN.
4. Carry out one or more rounds, repeating as necessary.
    1. Each round is an action and immediate response.
        1. Describe your action towards the desired outcome, what ability you uses, and how
much risk you take. “I want to climb straight up to that outcrop, taking chances if needed.” You can specify your AP bid; if you do not, your GN determines this based on the amount of risk you are taking. The size of the bid mirrors how bold and risky your character’s action is. Extreme or aggressive actions mean a high AP bid, and cautious actions require less.
        2. The ability used can be varied, but APs are always calculated on the first ability that you use in a contest. That ability must be used in the first round.
    2. You gamble a number of your APs in an attempt to reduce your opponent’s AP, but if you fail the attempt you lose the AP.
    3. Roll a die to determine the your degree of success or failure, then apply any bumps. Your GM 
does the same.
    4. Compare the results of the two die rolls on the Extended Contest Results table to determine who loses AP; only when you have a critical can you gain AP from your opponent. The AP bid is multiplied by this number before applying the results. Thus, if you bid 3 AP and the result is “Opponent loses 2x bid,” the loser loses 3 x 2 = 6 AP. Round half points up.
    5. Determine Contest Consequences. Each contestant’s AP total rises or falls during the contest as they gains the upper hand or are driven back. Exchanges continue until one contestant reaches 0 advantage points or fewer. At that point, the contest is over (even if it is the middle of a round). The loser’s final AP total determines the degree of success for the victor.
    6. The GM then hazards a number of APs for the resistance, in the same way.
5. Advantage points are only relevant for the length of a particular contest. Your PC does not have any until the next Extended contest begins, when you calculate them all over again

### Extended Contest Results

||Critical|Success|Failure|Fumble|
|:------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|
|Critical|High roll transfers ½x bid, else tie|Loser transfers 1x bid|Loser transfers 2x bid|Loser transfers 3x bid|
|Success|Loser transfers 1x bid|High roll loses ½x bid, else tie|Loser loses 1x bid|Loser loses 2x bid|
|Failure|Loser transfers 2x bid|Loser loses 1x bid|High roll loses ½x bid, else tie|Loser loses 1x bid|
|Failure|Loser transfers 3x bid|Loser loses 2x bid|Loser loses 1x bid| Tie*|


* In a group Extended Contest, the GM may declare that both contestants lose 1⁄2x bid to indicate that, although their results cancel out with respect to each other, their situation worsens compared to other contestants.

### 8.3.2 Advantage Points

#### 8.3.2.1  Bidding Advantage Points
 The size of your AP bid reflects the risk inherent in your actions. You describe your action and intent, and say how many AP you want to bid. If you describe an all-out offensive with your sword cutting vicious arcs, you need to bid a lot of AP; if you say that you are circling your foe cautiously, a low bid is in order. Your GM  will look at the level of risk you are taking, and may suggest that you change your bid to better match your actions. If you do not declare a bid before rolling the die, your GM will decide how many points are bid (using 3 as a default), with riskier actions calling for higher AP bids.

#### 8.3.2.3  Followers and Advantage Points

Followers can act in different ways during a contest, augmenting you with their abilities or allowing you to use one of your abilities as if it were your own. Alternatively, a follower with a relevant ability or keyword can simply add your AP to the PC’s at the beginning of the contest. 

Remember to figure any modifiers into your follower’s ability before adding it to the your starting AP total.

Neither you nor the GM makes rolls for followers. Instead, their actions are subsumed into yours. The follower’s relevant ability or keyword is used solely as a source of advantage points.

You can assign his followers to someone else, although you may have to succeed at a contest to convince a reluctant follower to go along.

#### 8.3.2.3 Advantage Point Knowledge

Once your opponent has won or lost advantage points during the current contest, you can ask the GM what the opposition's AP total is. This is where the element of skill comes in. When choosing how many AP to stake, you must weigh the effect they want to gain if you succeed versus the risk you face if the action fails.

## 8.4 Extended vs Scored Contests
We recommend that you choose one approach only, and stick to it, within a given presentation of QuestWorlds. Scored contests have the advantage of speed and simplicity. Extended contests have the advantage of allowing the players to bid each round, depending on the type of action they pursue.

## 8.5 Extremely Long Contests

There’s no particular time scale associated with contests. But some contests may by their very nature be a drama that can’t be resolved at one point in the narrative. Examples include political campaigns, construction projects, or seductions. These can be resolved by long contests where each round is conducted at an appropriate moment, rather than sequentially. Your GM will need to keep track of the resolution or advantage points and the resistance, though this might change as the context changes (a civil war started by the players could impede their castle-building plans). The challenges of each round will vary, and you may use a different ability or augment in the next exchange.

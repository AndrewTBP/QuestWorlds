# 3. Character Creation

The first step in creating your character is to come up with a concept that fits in with the genre of game that your GM intends to run. With that, you can assign abilities, ratings for those abilities, and if required flaws.

In addition, you will want to give your character a name, and provide a physical description. We recommend focusing on three physical things about your PC that others would immediately notice, over anything more detailed.

## 3.1 As-You-Go Method

1. Concept
The concept is a brief phrase, often just a couple of words, that tells the GM and other players what you do and how you act. When in doubt, start with a noun or phrase indicating your profession or area of expertise, and modify it with an adjective suggesting a dominant personality trait:

* haughty priestess
* hotshot lawyer
* naïve warrior
* noble samurai
* remorseful assassin
* sardonic ex-mercenary 
* slothful vampire

2. Now provide your character with a name.
3. If the series uses other keywords, such as those for culture or religion, you may one for free.
4. When events in the story put you in a situation where you want to overcome an obstacle, 
 make up an applicable ability on the spot. The first time you use an ability (including the two you start play with), assign an ability rating to it. This may be a breakout ability from a keyword. You are restricted to only one Sidekick.
5. If you want, describe flaws.
6. Once you have 12 abilities (including the two for character concept), and up to three flaws you are done creating your character.

## 3.2 Assigning Ability Ratings

You have now defined your abilities. These tell everyone what you can do. Now assign numbers to each ability, called ratings, which determine how well you can do these things.

 Assign a starting rating of 17 to the ability you find most important or defining. Although most players consider it wisest to assign this rating to their area of expertise, which is also often a keyword, you don’t have to do this. All other abilities start at a rating of 13.

Now spend up to 20 points to boost any of your various ability ratings, including keywords. Each point spent increases a rating by 1 point. You can’t spend more than 10 points on any one ability.

Some genre packs may require you to have additional keywords that reflect the setting. These additional keywords come from the 12 ability allowance, so in many genres you will have fewer wildcard abilities but better fit the setting.

## 3.3 Keywords

You may build your PC around one or more keywords. A keyword gives you a package deal: you get a number of abilities by selecting a pre-existing character concept, which the player then modifies. 

Keywords are best suited for use as the PC’s core area of expertise. 

In certain genres, you may require multiple keywords: for example, one for area of expertise, another for species or culture, and perhaps a third for religious af liation. 

Here are two ways to handle keywords. If in doubt, choose Umbrella.

**Keywords as Packages**: Treat keywords simply as shorthand for a package of abilities. These can be boosted together during character creation, but are too unrelated to increase together during a game. You are still free to use the keyword as an ability, and in fact may prefer to write only the specific abilities they’ve improved on their character sheet.

**Keywords as an Umbrella**: Treat keywords both as raisable abilities and as a collection of more specific abilities. This approach keeps the character sheet from getting too cluttered but encourages specialization. YOu write specialized abilities under the keyword, along with how much they've improved them:

In some settings, an ability may be listed in more than one of a PC’s keywords. Choose only one to detail it under.

we refer to specialized abilities under a keyword as break-out abilities.

## 3.3 Flaws

You may assign up to three flaws to their PC. Common flaws include:

* Personality traits:surly, petty, compulsive.
* Physical challenges:blindness, lameness, diabetes.
* Social hurdles: outcast, ill-mannered, hated by United supporters.

Flaws are assigned a rating equivalent to the your abilities. The first flaw is rated at the highest ability, the second shares the same rating as the second-highest ability, and the third equals the lowest ability.

Certain keywords include flaws. Flaws gained through keywords do not count against the limit of three chosen  flaws. All flaws after the third are given the same rating as the third ability. You may designate flaws from keywords as your first or second-ranked flaw. When flaws manifest during play, your GM places you in a contest against them, and rolls their associated ability ratings as Resistances to the your efforts. This method applies to flaws that primarily present you with additional obstacles to overcome.

Your GM may decide during play that certain flaws are better expressed as penalties to your attempts to overcome other resistances. Divide the value by 5 and round (a flaw of 19 imposes a –4 penalty). This is appropriate where the player specifies that your ability to solve problems drops under certain specific conditions. Examples might include:
* Tongue-tied in large gatherings. 
* Lousy with a stick shift.
* Can’t stand snakes.

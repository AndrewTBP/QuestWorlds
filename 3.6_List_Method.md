## 3.6 List Method

1. Concept

The concept is a brief phrase, often just a couple of words that tells the GM and other players what you do and how you act. When in doubt, start with a noun or phrase indicating your **occupation**, and modify it with an adjective suggesting a **distinguishing characteristic**:

* haughty priestess
* hotshot lawyer
* noble samurai
* remorseful assassin
* sardonic ex-mercenary
* slothful vampire
* naive warrior

2. Now provide the character with a name.
3. Note their **occupation**, which is usually a **keyword**. You probably already picked this when you came up with your character concept.
4. If the series uses other **keywords**, such as those for culture or religion, you may have one of them for free.
5. Pick 10 additional **abilities**, describing them however the player wants. Only one of these **abilities** may be a **sidekick**.
6. If you want, describe up to 3 **flaws**.

# 10. Optional: Community Resources and Support
Some series revolve around the relationship between a band of influential figures and the community they protect. In defense of the community, they can bolster, expend, and juggle its various resources.

It is possible for PCs to belong to several communities. Some societies nest communities within communities. Although characters may have community abilities related to any or all of these, the GM should model only one level of community. Pick the level of community that provides the greatest dramatic potential from its competition for resources, friendly or otherwise, with its rivals.

## 10.1 Community Design
### 10.1.1 Defining Resources
Communities can have any set of abilities the GM defines. The GM should Focus on no more than five or so broadly-labeled resource types, so that the characPCsters can care about (and have a chance of successfully managing) all of them. 

Most communities have variants of the following resources, perhaps with more colorful names:
* Wealth — measures the community’s material resources, whether counted primarily in dollars, credits, or cattle
* Diplomacy — the ability to extract favors from other communities, while minimizing the cost of its reciprocal obligations
* Morale — the community’s belief in its ability to achieve its goals, and willingness to follow the directives of its leaders
The following abilities might appear, depending on setting:
* Military — its ability to defend itself from outside threats, and to aggressively achieve its own aims through force of arms (for settings where communities of the size you’re tracking  eld their own armed units)
* Magic — the collective ability of its people to perform supernatural acts (for fantasy worlds)
* Technology — its access to specialized, rare or secret devices or scienti c knowledge not shared by its rivals (for post- apocalyptic or SF worlds)

Similar communities in the genre, should have the same set of resources.

### 10.1.2 Specify an interval.
Choose a suitable interval to mark changes in resources. For genres bound by the agricultural season, this is usually a season, for a military genre it might be a campaign, for a ship a voyage.

### 10.1.3 Assigning Ability Ratings
Distribute the following ratings between the  ve abilities: 12W, 9W, 18, 18, and 12. Note that the size of the group doesn’t affect the ratings.

A GM may create a questionnaire that asks the players to make choices about the history of their community. They can choose their multiple-choice answers by consensus, majority vote, or take turns. Each question secretly assigns a score to one or more resource types. When you’re done, rank the resources in the order of the scores, assigning the high ratings to the highest questionnaire results and the lowest to the low.

The questionnaire introduces your setting in a punchy, interactive format, and tailors the community to your players’ desires, increasing their investment in it.

### 10.1.4 Resource Notation
Keep track of modifiers to community resources with a copy of the following record sheet. Use a pencil, because the numbers will fluctuate.

List the names and ratings of your chosen resources in the first row. Under the total column for each, list the total current modifier. Under the PC column, list bonuses resulting from PC activities (as opposed to uncemented background events.) When PCs cement a background benefit, add its bonus to the PC column.

When PC activity reduces a penalty but does not eliminate it, alter the entry under the Total column to reflect the reduction, but leave the PC column blank.

RESOURCE NOTATION TABLE
| | | | | |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| | | | | |
|Total|PC|Total|PC|Total|PC|Total|PC|Total|PC|
| | | | | | | | | | |

## 10.2 Drawing on Resources
PCs can use resources as their own after convincing their people to let them expend precious assets. This requires a preliminary contest using a social ability, most likely the character’s community relationship. Use a Moderate resistance as your baseline, with higher resistances when the PC’s proposals seem selfish or likely to fail, and lower ones when everyone but the dullest dolt would readily see their collective benefits. Increase resistances if the group draws constantly on community resources without replenishing them.

The lobbying effort and the actual resource use require framing, a clear description of what the characters are doing, and other details to bring them to  ctional life. PCs can use resources directly, or to augment their own abilities.

Unlike character abilities, each use of community resources temporarily depletes it. 

On a victory, the characters win the prize specified by contest framing, and a penalty is applied to subsequent uses of the resource. 

On a defeat, the characters lose the prize and an even more severe penalty is applied to subsequent resource uses. If the PCs fail to secure the prize they were seeking, the depletion penalty is also applied to the PCs’ social and community abilities when interacting with members of their community. This reflects community displeasure at their fruitless expenditure. 

Penalties from the Resource Depletion Table replace standard penalties for defeat, not add to them.

Like other modifiers to resources, depletion penalties end at the end of the current interval. These include depletion penalties applied to character abilities. However, a depletion penalty left unattended at the end of the interval can result in a permanent drop in the relevant resource.

Narrators who want resource depletion to lead to longer-lasting social penalties can, at the cost of some extra bookkeeping, have the characters shed a 3-point penalty at the end of each interval.

RESOURCE DEPLETION TABLE
| | |
| ------------- | ------------- |  
|Contest Outcome|Depletion Penalty| 
|Complete Victory|0|
|Major Victory|-3|
|Minor Victory|-3|
|Marginal Victory|-3|
|Marginal Defeat|-6|
|Minor Defeat|-6|
|Major Defeat|-6|
|Complete Defeat|-9| 
  
### 10.2.1 Required Resource Use
As part of your setting design, you may specify that certain actions in a setting always require the use of a community resource. Because the resource use is obligatory, it need not meet the usual criteria for entertainment value. Also, when the resource is used as an augment, the PCs can also add a second augment from some other ability, adjudicated according to the standard rules, including entertainment value criteria. (This way, the required resource use doesn’t penalize you by forcing you to augment with a low-rated resource when you could otherwise use a higher-rated ability.)

### 10.2.2 Penalities to Resources
Threats to community resources act as a spur to PC action. The Narrator may rule that the penalty from any contest outcome may be applied to a resource. (It might at the same time be applied to one or more PC abilities.)

When choosing a penalty arising from a player defeat in a simple contest, use the Consequences Of Defeat table. For an extended contest, the penalty corresponds to the second worst state of adversity suffered by a defeated group member.

If groups voluntarily concede a contest by withdrawing, their communities suffer a Major Defeat.

### 10.2.3 Bolstering Resources
PCs can add bonuses to community resources by seeking out and overcoming relevant obstacles, specifying in the contest framing that the proceeds of victory go the community. If they succeed, bonuses from the Consequences Of Victory table are applied to a resource instead of one or more character abilities. (The Narrator may rule that the bonus also applies to PCs in social situations that involve community members, re ecting gratitude for their efforts on behalf of the community.)

### 10.2.4 Background Events
Changes to resources brought about by PCs take center stage in a series, but in the background all sorts of other events periodically alter the community’s prosperity. These include the actions of other community members, who are depleting and replenishing resources all the time, as well as the unexpected intrusion of outside forces.

At the beginning of each interval, ask one of the players' to perform a simple contest of each resource against a resistance equal to the average value of all resources. These contests simulate events outside of the PCs’ control or in uence; they can’t be augmented or bumped up with hero points. 

The result of the contest may apply a modifier to a resource, as per the following table:

RESOURCE FLUCTUATION TABLE
| | |
| ------------- | ------------- |  
|Contest Outcome|Depletion Penalty| 
|Complete Victory|+9|
|Major Victory|+6|
|Minor Victory|+3|
|Marginal Victory|0|
|Marginal Defeat|0|
|Minor Defeat|-3|
|Major Defeat|-6|
|Complete Defeat|-9| 


Except where the group is exceptionally keen on tracking resources, the GM should skip the background events process when the PCs are long absent from home. The GM should rejigger them to serve their plot purposes when they return. The GM may also want to shuffle this process offstage when the PCs are occupied by epic events. This prevents them from having to flee from a climactic plot development to go home and tend to the beet crop.

### 10.2.5 Crisis Tests
When resources endure penalties, the Narrator conducts a crisis test at the beginning of each game session to see if trouble strikes the community. A high but penalized rating can still lead to crisis, because people have adjusted to the equilibrium it offers and feel squeezed when it shifts on them.

A crisis test is a simple contest (one for each penalized ability) of the Resource rating against a resistance equal to the average of all resource ratings. Like background event checks, these can’t be augmented or bumped up by player action. On any defeat, the community starts to visibly suffer.

Invent specific reasons for each  fluctuation and narrate them to the players.

Resource crises spur the PCs to action, challenging them to find ways to bolster the affected resources (see above). When bolstered, the crisis is reversed. If the PCs neglect their duties or fail, the crisis worsens.

Use crisis tests only as needed, as a tool to generate story elements. If the group already has enough story on its hands, suspend them until you next need a new plot hook.

### 10.2.6 Cementing Benefits of Background Events
Bonuses from background events are temporary, unless the PCs take steps to lock in their benefits. Doing so requires the group to achieve a major goal, perhaps taking focus for an evening’s worth of play. If the PCs succeed, the background event bonus may, as per the next section, later solidify into a permanent increase in the resource’s rating.

When PCs cement a background bonus, the Narrator changes her notation of that bonus, attributing it to them.

## 10.3 Changes to Resource Ratings
At the end of your chosen interval, review your resource notation table.

Any resource with a bonus of 3 or more in its PC column increases by 1 for each 3 points of bonus, for a maximum increase of 3.

Any resource with a penalty in its Total column decreases by 1 for each 3 points of penalty, for a maximum loss of 2.

Any remaining modifiers are now reduced to 0.

Now start a new Resource Notation table, with resource ratings altered to re ect any changes from the above process.

Having made permanent changes to the community’s resource ratings, you then restart the cycle by again testing for a new set of background events.

## 10.4 Changes from Plot Events
You may decide that certain remarkable triumphs or horrifying catastrophes may directly alter a resource rating, independent of the resource tracking system given here. The possibility of a dramatic swing in community fortunes should be made clear by the Narrator during contest framing, so that the players know the stakes and can pull out all the stops to secure victory or stave off defeat.

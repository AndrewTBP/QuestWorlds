# Optional Mechanics
We flag some mechanics as Optional. 

The Questworlds engine is intended to be rules-lite, so we distinguish between the core mechanics, and options. Previous presentations included all the rules and whilst they suggested some were optional in the text were not explicit in tagging those rules. To make this SRD as flexible as possible we want to highlight which mechanics are optional; a rule in this section can be ommitted in any derived games presentation of the rules here. Sub-headings under a heading should be considered part of the optional content.

If this is your first time reading these rules, you may wish to skip reading these sections marked on first reading and return to them once you understand the core mechanics.

Optional mechanics can be brought in individually, they do not have to be all brought in together.

## Option: Resolution Methods
An optional resolution method is also available as follows:

#### Extended Contest
A sequence of die rolls, between one or more PCs and one or more supporting characters, breaks the conflict resolution into a series of actions. This method trades speed for detail. 

All contest types can resolve the actions of multiple characters acting at once, on either side of the conflict.

## Option: Resistance Progression
After two sessions of play, the base resistance increases by 1. After every subsequent two-session interval, it increases by another point. 

GMs may prefer other progression schemes that reflect the rate of advancement in their game, such as every four sessions of play (used in Heroquest 2.1e), or even every campaign.

## Option: Degrees of Success
Often all you need to know to interpret the results of a resolution is whether the character succeeded or failed. 

Sometimes, you’ll want to know how well a PC succeeded, or how badly he failed. This may be important in providing consequences or benefits, that drive futher story.

All of the resolution methods have an option to yield the degrees of success for the victor. The possible degrees of success, from least to greatest, are: marginal, minor, major, complete. Ties are also possible. 

If a PC contests against NPCs or abstract forces, the interpretation of the results reveals whether the PC gains the prize, and any consequences or benefits for the PC, and the GM narrate the fate of the NPCS or other forces depending on what makes sense. However, when two PC are engaged in a contest then a success for one contestant means a corresponding failure for the loser.

So whilst in a PC vs. PC duel the PC would only be killed on a Complete Defeat, an NPC, described as a resistance, might be killed on any victory, depending on how the prize was framed.

**Tie**: Tie means no result. Effort was expended, but the net result is that nothing consequential occurs, or else both sides lose or gain equally. If this is confusing, the PC gains a Marginal Victory.

**Marginal Victory**: Yes, but… The PC gets what they want, but there are complications, the effect is more limited than they desired, or they have to make a hard choice between benefits or accept a loss to get one

**Minor Victory**: Yes... The PC gets exactly what they want i.e. the stakes. 

**Major & Complete Victory**: Yes, and… The PC get the stakes, and something else. The PC gains something, stealing a possession, gaining a new follower, or become renowned in song. If you want to distinguish a Complete the effect is often permanent and no new contests should be framed for this prize. 

**Marginal Defeat**: No, but… The PC doesn't get what they want, they lose, but it’s not a total loss. They are able to salvage something from the defeat, a little more if they sacrifice something other than the prize to their opponent, that the opponents agrees to take instead.

**Minor Defeat**: No… They don't get what they want, they lose the stakes. Any consequences or complications such as injury or loss of influence are short term and easily shrugged off. Just take the loss and rest up.

**Major & Complete Defeat**: No and… You don’t get what you want, and there are long-term consequences. The situation might grow worse or more complicated or you might suffer adverse consequences that will require other conflicts to resolve: an injury that needs a healer, an insult that requires a formal apology, a loss of influence with the community that requires a triumph to win their trust again etc. You might be dead, or as good as. Or perhaps you lose something, an item is taken from you, a follower deserts you, your reputation lies in ruins as poets mock your defeat. If you want to distinguish, a Complete should be bigger loss than a Major, but you can ignore this distinction often. 

Use the degree of success to determine any side effects or lingering consequences, but be sure to describe the success in narrative terms.

If the is using a Stretch, then major or complete victories they might score are instead treated as minor victories.

## Option: Consequences
Contests, in addition to deciding whether the character gets the prize he was after, carry additional side effects, or consequences. These are negative if the character loses, and positive if he wins.

The GM may simply determine these from what makes fictional sense, given the agreed prize for the contest, as described above. Optionally the GM may impose Consequences of Defeat or provide Benefits of Victory if they desire ongoing penalties or bonuses. This rule is used in conjuction with Degrees of Success. The GM should always respond to the flow of the story, if narrative consequences are enough, don't reach for additional mechanical penalties. 

### The Consequences of Defeat
When heroes lose contests, they may suffer consequences: literal or metaphorical injuries which make it harder for the heroes to use related abilities.

• In a fight or test of physical mettle, heroes wind up literally wounded.
• In a social contest, they may suffer damage to their reputations.
• If commanding a war, they lose battalions, equipment, or territories.
• In an economic struggle, they lose money, other resources, or opportunities.
• In a morale crisis, heroes may suffer bouts of crippling self-doubt.

From the least to the most punishing, the five levels of consequences are: Hurt, Impaired, Injured, Dying, and Dead. The first four are possible results of any contest. Dying heroes become dead, unless they receive intervention of some sort. 

#### Healthy
PCs who aren’t in a state of adversity at all are considered healthy.

It is possible to seem banged up without suffering any measurable penalties. If you get into an extended contest during which you were at a disadvantage for a long time and  nally came from behind for the win, you may seem bruised, winded, anxious, or otherwise the worse for wear. Although this apparent harm may yield you useful sympathy, it doesn’t actually slow you down at all.

#### Dazed
In some situations, the Narrator may rule that a character is dazed. They are conscious but unable to initiate actions of their own. If another character engages them in a contest, they can snap out of it and defend themselves.

#### Hurt
A hurt PC shows signs of adversity and finds it harder to succeed at contests related to their defeat. Either their flesh or pride may be bruised. Until the PC recovers, they suffer a –3 penalty to all related abilities.

Characters may suffer multiple hurts to the same ability. These are cumulative until recovery occurs.

Unless the GM has a compelling dramatic reason to decide otherwise, hurts vanish at the end of a session, after one day of rest per accumulated hurt, or when in-game events justify their removal.

#### Impaired
An Impaired PC has taken a jarring blow, physically, socially, or emotionally, and is much likelier to fail when attempting similar actions in the future. THey suffers a –6 penalty to all related abilities. Impairments combine with hurts and with other impairments.

As bad as the character’s condition may be, there’s nothing wrong with him that some prolonged inactivity won’t fix. A single impairment goes away after one week of rest, or when an in-game event (like miraculous or extraordinary treatment) occurs to make their removal seem believable.

#### Injured
An injured PC  has suffered a debilitating shock to the system, one which renders them all but helpless.

To even participate in a contest, they must succeed at a prior contest of wherewithal to rouse themself to action. Appropriate abilities for contests of wherewithal might include:

• Physical action: Endurance, High Pain Threshold, Grim Determination, etc.
• Intellectual activity: Concentration, Iron Will, Love Of Country (if action to be attempted is patriotic), etc.
• Social humiliation: Savoir Faire, Un appable, Stoic Dignity

A contest of wherewithal faces a Moderate resistance. Even if the injured PC succeeds at the contest of wherewithal, they take an automatic bump down whenever they use any related ability in a contest. (The bump down does not apply to the contest of wherewithal itself.) Where it seems apt, the GM may choose to ignore the bump down if the PC scores a major or complete victory on the contest of wherewithal.

Any active hurts or impairments continue to be counted against him as well.

#### Dying
A dying PC will, without rapid and appropriate intervention, soon expire. To save them, the PCs must typically overcome a story obstacle and/or succeed at a difficult contest. According to the conventions of dramatic storytelling, the character typically has just enough time left for the other characters to make this one attempt.

Successful intervention leaves the PC injured. Depending on the narrative circumstances, a complete victory on the intervention attempt may leave them merely impaired.

If intervention fails, the character will die, but not necessarily immediately. Although irrevocably doomed, they may survive long enough to deliver a poignant final speech.The PC is unable to perform any task complicated enough to require a contest.

Like other states of adversity, dying may be literal or metaphorical. Your standing in society, business or politics may be on the brink of permanent extinction. You may be facing mental death—a permanent lapse into madness or senility. 

#### Dead
A PC who dies as a result of physical injuries is gone from the game, period. 

Death from a non-physical contest will likely be metaphorical. If you die in an economic, social, spiritual, or artistic contest, you permanently lose abilities.

Even only metaphorically dead, the GM may declare that the PC has undergone changes so dire as to make them unplayable. They may be incurably insane, or so socially shamed that they retire to a life of obscurity or religious meditation. They may be shunned by all around them, sent into permanent exile, or sentenced to long-term imprisonment with no hope of escape.

CONSEQUENCES OF DEFAT TABLE
| | | |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
|Defeat Level|State of Adversity|Penalty|
|Marginal|Hurt|–3 penalty to appropriate abilities| 
|Minor|Impaired|–6 penalty to appropriate abilities|
|Major|injured|Automatic bump down on uses of appropriate ability|
|Complete|Dying| No actions allowed|

### Benefits of Victory
Just as PCs who suffer defeat can suffer ongoing ill effects in addition to the loss of the prize at hand, PCs who win can gain extra benefits of victory.

The PC gets a bonus on the selected abilities, or in the specified situation, as determined by their victory level. The bonus remains until the PC suffers a defeat on a contest using either the bonus or the ability with which they won the original contest. A PC can’t decline the bonus because they might lose it; they must always use it in any contest in which it ought, in the GM’s judgment, to apply.

At the end of a storyline, especially when a significant period of game-world time passes between the conclusion of one episode and the beginning of the next, the GM may declare that all benefits of victory have expired.

A PC may apply bonuses from multiple benefits to a single contest.

BENEFITS OF VICTORY TABLE
| | |
| ------------- | ------------- |
|Victory Level|Benefit|
|Marginal|+0|
|Minor|+3|
|Major|+6|
|Complete|+9|

### Recovery and Healing
Consequences of Injured or less lapse on their own with the passage of time. However, you’ll often want to remove them ahead of schedule, with the use of abilities.

#### Healing Abilities
The ability used to bring about recovery from a state of adversity must relate to the type of harm sustained by the victim.

Physical injuries can be healed by medical abilities. 

Mental traumas, including those of con dence and morale, may be removed with mundane psychology or through extraordinary abilities. They might also be removed through a dramatic confrontation between the victim and the source of the psychic injury.

Social injuries must be healed through social abilities. They probably require public expiation of some sort, often including a negotiation with the offended parties and the payment of reparations, either tangible or symbolic.

Damage to items and equipment requires some sort of repair ability. Extraordinary items may require genre-specific expertise: a broken magic ring may require a ritual to reforge.

Healing attempts will almost always unfold as simple contests. An exception might be a medical drama, in which surgeries would comprise the suspenseful set-piece sequences of the game.

#### Resistances
Default resistances to remove states of adversity are as follows:

 HEALING RESISTANCES TABLE
| | |
| ------------- | ------------- |
|Consequence of Defeat|Difficulty|
|Hurt|Low|
|Impaired|Moderate|
|Injured|High|
|Dying|Very High|

#### Consequences of Healing
A successful healing attempt removes one level of adversity for each level of victory. A major defeat increases the subject’s consequence of defeat by 1; a complete defeat adds an additional 2 levels to the consequence of adversity.

## Option: Modifiers
Where an ability rating represents a general ability to succeed in the narrative, modifiers reflect specific conditions that may make it easier or harder to overcome particular obstacles. They are applied to your ability to get a final target number (TN).

Positive modifiers are called bonuses; negative modifiers are called penalties.

Positive modifiers, or bonuses, may raise an ability high enough to gain a mastery, in which case the character gets the bumps up or down that a mastery would normally supply.

Negative modifiers, or penalties, may lower an ability to the point where it loses one or more masteries. In this case, the character loses the bumps up or down he would normally get.

Modifiers should only be used to alter a PC’s target number to respect unusual circumstances he helped to create, or has some control over. If an unusual situation applies to a resistance, change the resistance number. 

If penalties reduce a target number to 0 or less, any attempt to use it automatically results in  failure. The character must find another way to achieve his aim.

### Stretches
When you propose an action using an ability that seems completely inappropriate, the GM rules it impossible. If you went ahead and tried it anyway, you’d automatically fail—but you won’t, because that would be silly.

In some cases, though, your proposed match-up of action and ability is only somewhat implausible. A successful attempt with it wouldn’t completely break the illusion of  fictional reality—just stretch it a bit. 

Using a somewhat implausible ability is known as a stretch. If the GM deems an attempt to be a stretch, the PC suffers a –6 penalty to their target number. 

The definition of stretch is elastic, depending on genre. 

GMs should not impose stretch penalties on action descriptions that add  flavor and variety to a scene, but do not fundamentally change what the character can do with his ability. These make the scene more fun but don’t really gain any advantage.

### Situational Modifiers
GMs may also impose modifiers when, given the description of the current situation, believability demands that a character should face a notable advantage or disadvantage. Assess modifiers of +6, +3, –3, or –6. Modi ers of less than 3 don’t exert enough statistical effect to be worth the bother. Those higher than 6 give the situational modi er a disproportionate role in determining results.

During an extended contest, they should typically last for a single exchange, and reflect clever or foolish choices by the character. 

### Engaging Multiple Opponents
If more than one opponent engages a PC (or NPC), they take part in a number of contests equal to the number of opponents. For each extra contest they are forced to participate in during a given round, they suffer a cumulative -3 penalty.

A GM should resolve all engagements against a single PC/NPC at once, adjusting the order of action as necessary. A player can choose the order in which their PC engages their respective opponents. It’s usually smartest to engage them in order of relative toughness, from highest to lowest rating.

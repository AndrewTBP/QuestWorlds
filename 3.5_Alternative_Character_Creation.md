## 3.5 Alternative Character Creation

*QuestWorlds* offers two alternative methods of character creation: prose and list.

### 3.5.1 The List Method

This is like the As-You-Go method (see ยง3.1) but you spend all their points before the game begins. This is possible with the As-You-Go method as well, but the list method allows you to signal what they want the game to be about from the abilities you pick, as opposed to reacting to material once the game begins.

### 3.5.2 The Prose Method

This is the most different method as you write a piece of prose and then pull **abilities** from that. Its intent is to emulate a character description in fiction, and indeed PCs can be built by copying text from a story and then identifying **keywords**. It is the least 'fair' of the character creation options.

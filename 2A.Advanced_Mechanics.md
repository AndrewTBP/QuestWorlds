## 2.7 Advanced Mechanics

You can play QuestWorlds with just the basic mechanics, and we recommend start with this simpler set of rules whilst your GM masters the less-familiar ideas like story obstacles instead of task resolution, that make QuestWorlds different from traditional RPGs.

The Advanced mechanics add detail to the Basic mechanics, which add detail, or generate in-game story developments, at the cost of more complexity.

## 2.8 Resolution Methods

An Advanced resolution method is available:

### 2.8.1 Long Contest

An Advanced rule, Long Contests, lets you zoom-in to task-level contests to play out struggling with a series of tasks in order to overcome the obstacle, such as blow-by-blow exchanges with the king's champion in front of the tower where your father is held hostage, or exposing the lies of a witness in the court room to free a wrongly accused innocent man.

Your GM should resolve most conflicts using the simple contest rules. However, every so often, your GM may want to stretch out the resolution, breaking it down into a series of actions. Your GM should do this when they want to give you a chance to make your PC shine, by focusing in on how they handle themselves in a difficult situation, and giving them a chance to show their range of abilities.

As a rule of thumb, if you want resolution that moves closer to the task level, a long contest may be appropriate.

A sequence of die rolls, between one or more PCs and one or more supporting characters, breaks the conflict resolution into a series of actions.

A Long Contest trades speed for detail. For the flow of a story we recommend using simple contests as much as possible. If you come from other roleplaying games that have task based contests, we recommend playing only using simple contests, until you have mastered the different approach of conflict based contests, before introducing Long Contests.

More details on Long Contests are available in their own section.

### 2.8.2 Escalating Contests

If your GM chooses Scored Contests form of Long Contest you can use an option called Escalating Contests.

Escalating Contests allow your GM to switch a Simple Contest to a Long Contest. To do this, simply re-interpret the Simple Contest results as the first round of a Scored Contest. For example, in a contest of magic at the Thaumaturgical Academy, Billiard, your PC, gains a Marginal Victory over his opponent Crowsky. The GM narrates the outcome, but although you get what you agreed, you want Crowskey to be humiliated. Your GM agrees to an Escalating Contest, treating the result as the first round of a Scored Contest, and scores 1 RP against Crowsky before beginning adjudication with the second round.

Escalating Contests can serve three functions:

* If you take part in a contest and after hearing the narrative feel aggrieved that you could not bring more abilities to bear, and the GM agrees that it would be interesting to let you shine for a moment, an escalating contest helps you bring more abilities into the contest.
* If you take part in a contest but the degree of success was not emotionally satisfying, an escalating contest gives you another chance to achieve the result you want.
* If your GM is unsure if a Simple or Long Contest is appropriate then they can default to a Simple Contest and switch to Escalating if required.

If you wish to use Escalating Contests, you need to chose Scored Contests as your Long Contest option.

## 2.9 Resistance Progression

Your GM may decide that resistance to your actions gets harder, as the campaign progresses. This reflects the trope of the type of challenges you face getting tougher as you improve.

Your GM should adopt a strategy that mimics a TV show more where the resistance does not increase during a season of the show, allowing our protagonists to get more competent as the show progresses towards its climax. In the next season though the resistance usually goes up, and the writers reflect this with more challenging opposition in the new season of the show. At the same time, the oppositon that was tough in the first season, now become mooks that can be easily dispatched to show the increased competence of our heroes.

In that case your GM should bump the resistance by +3, +6 or +9 for the next campaign you play with the same characters. The size of the change should reflect the increase in your previous abilities in the last campaign. For example, if in the last season you increased your occupation keyword by +6, your GM may decide to increase the resistance by +3 or +6 to reflect the more challenging opposition in the new campaign. Your GM should also take into account that the opposition you were improving with respect to in the previous season should now be considered more-easily defeated mooks, and use lower resistance ratings for them when they appear in the story.

### 2.9.1 No Progression

Your GM may also decide that the resistances do not get harder as the campaign progresses, reflecting the PCs ability to disregard minor challenges, and simply choose harder resistances to challenge the players.

## 2.10 Degrees of Success

Often all you need to know to interpret the results of a resolution is whether you succeeded or failed.

Sometimes, you’ll want to know how well you succeeded, or how badly you failed. This may be important in providing consequences or benefits, that drive further story.

All of the resolution methods have an option to yield the degrees of success for the victor. The possible degrees of success, from least to greatest, are: marginal, minor, major, complete. Ties are also possible.

If you contest against NPCs or abstract forces, the interpretation of the results reveals whether you overcome the obstacle, and any consequences or benefits; your GM narrate the fate of the NPCS or other forces depending on what makes sense. However, when you and another PC engage in a contest then a success for one contestant means a corresponding failure for the loser.

So whilst in a PC vs. PC duel the PC would only be killed on a Complete Defeat, an NPC, described as a resistance, might be killed on any victory, depending on how the contest was framed.

**Tie**: Tie means no result. Effort was expended, but the net result is that nothing consequential occurs, or else both sides lose or gain equally. If this is confusing, and you are not contending with another PC, your GM can rule that you gain a Marginal Victory.

**Marginal Victory**: Yes, but… You get what you want, but there are complications, the effect is more limited than you desired, or you have to make a hard choice between benefits or accept a loss to get one

**Minor Victory**: Yes... You gets exactly what they want i.e. whatever was at stakes in the contest. 

**Major & Complete Victory**: Yes, and… You get the stakes, and something else. You gain something, stealing a possession, gaining a new follower, or become renowned in song. If you want to distinguish a Complete the effect is often permanent and no new contests should be framed for this obstacle.

**Marginal Defeat**: No, but… You don't get what you want, you lose, but it’s not a total loss. You are able to salvage something from the defeat, a little more if you sacrifice something other than the prize to your opponent, that the opponents agrees to take instead.

**Minor Defeat**: No… You don't get what you want, you lose the stakes. Any consequences or complications such as injury or loss of influence are short term and easily shrugged off. Just take the loss and rest up.

**Major & Complete Defeat**: No and… You don’t get what you want, and there are long-term consequences. The situation might grow worse or more complicated or you might suffer adverse consequences that will require other conflicts to resolve: an injury that needs a healer, an insult that requires a formal apology, a loss of influence with the community that requires a triumph to win their trust again etc. You might be dead, or as good as. Or perhaps you lose something, an item is taken from you, a follower deserts you, your reputation lies in ruins as poets mock your defeat. If you want to distinguish, a Complete should be bigger loss than a Major, but you can ignore this distinction often.

Your GM will use the degree of success to determine any side effects or benefits and consequences, but be sure to describe the success in narrative terms.

If you are using a Stretch, then major or complete victories you score are instead treated as minor victories.

## 2.11 Benefits and Consequences

Contests, in addition to deciding whether you overcome an obstacle, carry additional side effects, or consequences. These are negative if you lose, and positive if you win.

Your GM may simply determine these from what makes fictional sense, given the agreed prize for the contest, as described above. Optionally your GM may impose Consequences of Defeat or provide Benefits of Victory if they desire ongoing penalties or bonuses. This rule is used in conjunction with Degrees of Success. Your GM should always respond to the flow of the story, if narrative consequences are enough, they should not reach for additional mechanical penalties.

### 2.11.1 The Consequences of Defeat

When you lose a contest, you may suffer consequences: literal or metaphorical injuries which make it harder for you to use related abilities.

* In a fight or test of physical mettle, you wind up literally wounded.
* In a social contest, you suffer damage to your reputation.
* If commanding a war, you lose battalions, equipment, or territories.
* In an economic struggle, you lose money, other resources, or opportunities.
* In a morale crisis, you may suffer bouts of crippling self-doubt.

From the least to the most punishing, the five states of adversity are: Hurt, Impaired, Injured, Dying, and Dead. The first four are possible results of any contest. Dying PCs become dead, unless they receive intervention of some sort.

Although the levels refer to physical states of well-being, the consequences can be emotional, social, spiritual, magical, and so on.

#### 2.11.1.2 Hurt

If you are hurt, you show signs of adversity and find it harder to succeed at contests related to your defeat. Either your flesh or pride may be bruised. Until you recover, you suffer a –3 penalty to all related abilities.

You may suffer multiple hurts to the same ability. These are cumulative until recovery occurs.

Unless your GM has a dramatic reason to decide otherwise, your hurts vanish at the end of a session, after one day of rest per accumulated hurt, or when in-game events justify their removal.

#### 2.11.1.3 Impaired

If you are Impaired, you have taken a jarring blow, physically, socially, or emotionally, and you are much likelier to fail when attempting similar actions in the future. You suffer a –6 penalty to all related abilities. Impairments combine with hurts and with other impairments.

As bad as your condition may be, there’s nothing wrong with you that some prolonged inactivity won’t fix. A single impairment goes away after one week of rest, or when an in-game event (like miraculous or extraordinary treatment) occurs to make their removal seem believable.

#### 2.11.1.4 Injured

If you are injured, you have suffered a debilitating blow which leaves you reeling. Physically you may have have lost the use of a limb or sense, socially you may be shunned, and emotionally you may in shock. Although you should heal with time, you suffer a -9 penalty to all related abilities. Injuries combine with impairments and hurts.

A single injury goes away after a month's rest, or by miraculous intervention, as above.

#### 2.11.1.5 Dying

If you are dying you will, without rapid and appropriate intervention, expire. To save you, the other PCs must overcome a story obstacle. Their attempt must be credible, using medicine or magic, as defined by your genre. Your GM should use a Very High resistance for this contest, unless the story suggests otherwise. According to the conventions of dramatic storytelling, the character typically has just enough time left for the other characters to make this one attempt.

Successful intervention leaves the PC injured. Depending on the narrative circumstances, a complete victory on the intervention attempt may leave them merely impaired.

If intervention fails, you will die, but not necessarily immediately. Although irrevocably doomed, your GM may rule that the story suggests that you survive long enough to take one final, heroic, action.

To even take that final action if the GM offers you the chance, then you must succeed at a prior contest of wherewithal to rouse yourself to action. Appropriate abilities for the contests of wherewithal include:

* Physical action: Endurance, High Pain Threshold, Grim Determination, etc.
* Intellectual activity: Concentration, Iron Will, Love Of Country (if action to be attempted is patriotic), etc.
* Social humiliation: Savoir Faire, Unflappable, Stoic Dignity

A contest of wherewithal faces a Moderate resistance. Even if you succeed at the contest of wherewithal, you take an automatic bump down whenever you use any related ability in a contest. (The bump down does not apply to the contest of wherewithal itself.) Where it seems apt, your GM may choose to ignore the bump down if you score a major or complete victory on the contest of wherewithal.)

Any active hurts or impairments continue to be counted against you as well.

Your final action cannot reverse the outcome of the contest that you lost, it must involve a new story obstacle. Your GM will rule if you action is allowable.

Like other states of adversity, dying may be literal or metaphorical. Your standing in society, business or politics may be on the brink of permanent extinction. You may be facing mental death — a permanent lapse into madness or senility.

#### 2.11.1.6 Dead

If you die as a result of physical injuries, you are gone from the game, period.

Death from a non-physical contest will likely be metaphorical. If you die in an economic, social, spiritual, or artistic contest, you permanently lose abilities.

Even only metaphorically dead, your GM may declare that you have undergone changes so dire as to make your PC unplayable. You may be incurably insane, or be so socially shamed that you retire to a life of obscurity or religious meditation. You may be shunned by all around you, sent into permanent exile, or sentenced to long-term imprisonment with no hope of escape.

### CONSEQUENCES OF DEFAT TABLE

|Defeat Level|State of Adversity|Penalty|
|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|
|Marginal|Hurt|–3 penalty to appropriate abilities|
|Minor|Impaired|–6 penalty to appropriate abilities|
|Major|injured|–9 penalty to appropriate abilities|
|Complete|Dying| No actions allowed. If 'final action', automatic bump down on uses of appropriate ability|

### 2.11.2 Benefits of Victory

Just as when you experience defeat you can suffer ongoing ill effects in addition to the loss of the prize at hand, when you win you can gain benefits from that victory.

A benefit of victory gives you a bonus on the selected abilities, or in the specified situation, as determined by your victory level.

* In a fight or test of physical mettle, your workout leaves you sharp for the next encounter.
* In a social contest, you gain confidence and admiration from your triumph.
* If commanding a war, you gain strategic advantage over your enemy.
* In an economic struggle, your profits can be re-invested, or you drive competitors into the ground.
* In a morale crisis, you are buoyed up by success, nothing can stop you now.

Remember that the benefit does not have to be directly related to the ability used. Look to the goal of the contest. The abilities or situation should reflect the story obstacle that was overcome and the tactics used to overcome it.

* In a fight or test of physical mettle, your triumph has everyone rallying to your cause.
* In a social contest, you win powerful allies who will strengthen your in your fight against your enemies.
* If commanding a war, you pillage the enemy city and enrich your army.
* In an economic struggle, you gain status as one of the wealthy elite.
* In a morale crisis, your rallied troops strengthen your army.

A PC may apply bonuses from multiple benefits to a single contest.

From the least to the most robust the four states of fortune are: Fresh, Pumped, Invigorated, and Heroic.

#### 2.11.2.1 Fresh

If you are Fresh, you are lively and find it easier to succeed at contests related to your victory. You are on a roll and feel confident and able. Until you are defeated, you gain a +3 bonus to all related abilities.

You may be refreshed multiple times on the same ability. These are cumulative until defeat occurs.

Unless your GM has a dramatic reason to decide otherwise, your freshness vanishes at the end of a session, after one day of idleness, or when in-game events justify their removal.

#### 2.11.1.3 Pumped

If you are Pumped, you are energized, physically, socially, or emotionally, and you are much likelier to succeed when attempting similar actions in the future. You gain a +6 bonus to all related abilities. Pumped combines with Fresh and Pumped.

As good as your condition may be, an extended period of idleness will cause you to lose your edge. A single Pumped goes away after one week of idleness, or when an in-game event (like long drunken party) occurs to make their removal seem believable.

#### 2.11.1.4 Invigorated

If you are Invigorated, you are pulsing with hormones, mentally focused, or exuding confidence. Physically you can push your body to new personal bests of achievement, socially confidant and exuding charisma, and emotionally you are in touch with your feelings and resonate with those of others. Although this will fade with time, you gain a +9 benefit to all related abilities. Invigorated combines with Pumped and Fresh.

Being Invigorated goes away after a month's idleness, or an in-game event, as above.

#### 2.11.1.5 Heroic

If you are heroic, you have become unstoppable, physically at peak performance, socially, everyone wants to be you or be with you, and emotionally you have gained new insights into yourself and others around you. Although this will fade with time, you gain a bump up to all related abilities. Heroic combines with invigorated, pumped and fresh.

Being heroic goes away after a season's idleness, or an in-game event, as above.

### BENEFITS OF VICTORY TABLE

|Victory Level|State of Adversity|Benefit|
|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|
|Marginal|Fresh|+3|
|Minor|Pumped|+6|
|Major|Invigorated|+9|
|Complete|Heroic|You receive an automatic bump up on uses of an appropriate ability|

#### 2.11.2.1 Clearly Inferior Opponents

Defeating clearly inferior opponents neither teaches you anything nor significantly enhances
your reputation; you are ineligible for a benefit of victory if the resistance you used in the contest exceeded the resistance by 6 or more. If, in the case of long contest, you or your opponent used multiple abilities, compare the best ability you used to his worst.

### 2.11.3 Recovery and Healing

Consequences of Injured or less lapse on their own with the passage of time. However, you’ll often want to remove them ahead of schedule, with the use of abilities.

#### 2.11.3.1 Healing Abilities

The ability used to bring about recovery from a state of adversity must relate to the type of harm.

You can heal physical injuries with medical or extraordinary abilities. 

You can remove mental traumas, including those of confidence and morale, with mundane psychology or through extraordinary abilities. You might also remove then through a dramatic confrontation between the victim and the source of the psychic injury.

You use social abilities to heal social injuries. You probably have to make a public apology of some sort, often including a negotiation with the offended parties and the payment of compensation, either in disposable wealth or something more symbolic.

You can fix damage to items and equipment with some sort of repair ability. If you want to fix an extraordinary item, you may require genre-specific expertise: a broken magic ring may require a ritual to reforge.

Your GM should almost always resolve healing attempts as simple contests. An exception might be a medical drama, in which surgeries would comprise the suspenseful set-piece sequences of the game, and your GM might chose an Long Contest.

#### 2.11.3.2 Healing Resistances

Default resistances to remove states of adversity are as follows:

### HEALING RESISTANCES TABLE

|Consequence of Defeat|Difficulty|
|:-------------:|:-------------:|
|Hurt|Low|
|Impaired|Moderate|
|Injured|High|
|Dying|Very High|

#### 2.11.3.3 Results of Healing

When you make a successful healing attempt, you remove one level of adversity for each level of victory. A major defeat increases the subject’s consequence of defeat by 1; a complete defeat adds an additional 2 levels to the consequence of adversity.

### 2.11.4 Waning Benefits

Just as you recover from consequences with time, or through healing, so benefits fade with time.

At the end of a storyline, especially when a significant period of game-world time passes between the conclusion of one episode and the beginning of the next, the GM may declare that all benefits have expired.

### 2.11.5 Benefits Meet Consequences

Because it is confusing to track both benefits and consequences against the same ability your GM may simply rule that one cancels the other out. This is particularly true of social contests where a moment of shame can erase your previous triumphs, or your confidence eroded by a failure. Physical benefits may cancel out, flushed with victory you may be able to ignore pain, but it may defy credibility for wounds to be healed by an athletic performance.

Your GM may simply rule that benefits and consequences cancel out, or they may take the difference between the two benefits and create a new one. For example if you are Invigorated by your previous performance in the dance contest, but then suffer a Hurt, your GM may rule that your twisted ankle cancels out your energy from the last performance, or your GM might rule that your success sees you through the pain, but you are now only Pumped.

## 2.11 Modifiers

Your ability rating represents a general ability to succeed in the narrative, but modifiers reflect specific conditions that may make it easier or harder to overcome particular obstacles. They are applied to your ability to get a final target number (TN).

Positive modifiers are called bonuses; negative modifiers are called penalties.

Positive modifiers, or bonuses, may raise your ability high enough to gain a mastery, in which case you get the bumps up or down that a mastery would normally supply.

Negative modifiers, or penalties, may lower an ability to the point where it loses one or more masteries. In this case, you lose the bumps up or down you would normally get.

Your GM should only use modifiers to alter your target number due to unusual circumstances you helped to create, or have some control over. If an unusual situation applies to a resistance, the GM should choose a resistance that reflects that. Modifiers never apply to the resistance.

If penalties reduce your target number to 0 or less, any attempt to use it automatically results in  failure. You must find another way to achieve his aim.

### 2.12.1 Stretches

When you propose an action using an ability that seems completely inappropriate, your GM rules it impossible. If you went ahead and tried it anyway, you’d automatically fail—but you won’t, because that would be silly.

In some cases, though, your proposed match-up of action and ability is only somewhat implausible. A successful attempt with it wouldn’t completely break the illusion of fictional reality—just stretch it a bit.

Using a somewhat implausible ability is known as a stretch. If your GM deems an attempt to be a stretch, the PC suffers a –6 penalty to their target number.

The definition of stretch is elastic, depending on genre.

Your GM should not impose stretch penalties on action descriptions that add flavor and variety to a scene, but do not fundamentally change what you can do with your ability. These make the scene more fun but don’t really gain any advantage.

### 2.12.2 Situational Modifiers

Your GM may also impose modifiers when, given the description of the current situation, believability demands that you should face a notable advantage or disadvantage. Your GM should choose modifiers of +6, +3, –3, or –6. Modifiers of less than 3 don’t exert enough effect to be worth the bother. Those higher than 6 give the situational modifier a disproportionate role in determining results.

During an Long Contest, they should typically last for a single exchange, and reflect clever or foolish choices.

### 2.12.3 Engaging Multiple Opponents

If your face more than one opponent, you take part in a number of contests equal to the number of your opponents. For each extra opponent, you are forced to participate in during a given round, you suffer a cumulative -3 penalty.

Your GM should resolve all engagements against you at once, adjusting the order of action as necessary. You can choose the order in which you engage your opponents. It’s usually smartest to engage them in order of relative toughness, from highest to lowest rating.

## 2.13 Combined Abilities

On certain occasions your GM may rule that you can only hope to achieve your goal by using two disparate abilities. When this occurs, average your two ability ratings, then apply any modifiers, to arrive at your TN.

Combining your abilities, rather than using the best one and augmenting it with other, is always a disadvantage. Your GM should only require combined ability use when story logic absolutely demands that you face a lower chance of success, because you have to do two things at once.

## 2.14 Mobs, Gangs, and Hordes

Sometimes you will face large numbers of individually inconsequential opponents. Your GM can roll for each of them separately, taking note of the multiple opponent penalties they incur against their enemies.

More simply, your GM can treat many as one. They divide the number of minor opponents by the number of contesting PCs. Your GM then treats each of these sections of the crowd as a single opponent with one ability rating. They don’t impose a multiple opponent penalty; instead, their numbers are factored into the ability rating your GM assigns to them. 

When the mob loses an exchange, your GM describes individuals within it as being hurt or falling away. When it wins, describe them overwhelming you, or swelling in numbers.

## 2.15 Mass Effort

Clashes of massive forces resolve like any other contest, Simple or Long, solo or group. These include:

* Military engagements
* Corporate struggles for market share • Building competitions
* Efforts to spread a faith or ideology • Dance competitions

If you are not participating in the contest and have no stake in its outcome, then your GM doesn’t bother to run a contest. The GM just chooses an outcome for dramatic purposes.

Otherwise, your GM will start by determining your degree of influence over the outcome. They are either:

* Determining factors: The success of the effort depends mostly on your choices and successes. For example, you might be a military leader facing a force of roughly equal potency. As all else is equal, the better general will win the day. In this instance, your tactic should be a relevant leadership ability.
* Contributors: One of the forces enjoys a clear advantage over the others, but the your efforts may tip the balance in favor of a chosen side. Your GM will tell give you a TN to roll against that represents the strength of your force, but you can augment that TN with an appropriate leadership ability.
* Acted Upon: You have little influence over the outcome, but are stuck in the middle of the conflict and must struggle to prosper within it. The GM predetermines the outcome of the overall competition on dramatic grounds. To determine your fate in the battle, you contest against a resistance determined by the GM, derived from the overall battle outcome.

## 2.16 Pyrrhic Victories

In a Pyrrhic victory, you boost your chance of success in a contest by accepting negative consequence at its end, even if you succeed in overcoming the story obstacle. You gain a bump in the ability you are using to prosecute the contest, but at the contest’s end, you suffer a state of adversity, as per the Pyrrhic Victory Table.

As with any proposed action, you must convincingly describe the potentially suicidal risks
you are taking to achieve their objective. You must also show how these risks can bring you the awful victory they seek.

### PYRRHIC VICTORY CONSEQUENCES TABLE

|Outcome|State of Adversity|
|:-------------:|:-------------:|
|Any Defeat|Dead|
|Marginal Victory|Dead|
|Minor Victory|Dying|
|Major Victory|Injured|
|Complete Victory|Impaired|

## 2.17 Mismatched and Graduated Goals

Sometimes, the two sides in a contest may have goals that do not directly conflict one another. A huntsman pursues a nurse, who is trying to escape through the forest with two small children. The huntsman wants to kill the nurse. The nurse wants to save the children.

When encountering mismatched goals, your GM should determine whether the mismatch is complete, or partial.

In a complete mismatch, neither side is at all interested in preventing the other’s goal. A complete mismatch does not result in a contest; your GM asks what you are doing, and then describes each participant succeeding at their goals.

In most instances, the contest goals are not actually mismatched, but graduated. You have both a primary and a secondary goal. In this case, your GM frames the contest, identifying which goal is which. To achieve both, you must score a major or complete victory. On a minor or marginal victory, you achieve only the primary goal. Your GM may present you with the choice of which objective you obtain, where that choice illuminates your PC's priorities.

## 2.18 Difficult Auto-Success

Two distinct methods allow your GM to create a sense of difficulty without allowing for the prospect of failure: the arduous automatic success, and the costly success. Your GM will use a costly success where failure offers no entertaining plot branches, but when they still want the group to work for victory. In a costly success, you succeed, but at a price.

### 2.18.1 Arduous Auto-Success

Your GM will use an arduous automatic success to help with pacing. They will simply allow you to succeed without a contest, and then describe in sweat-inducing detail your hard-won victory. Unlike the standard automatic success, the objective here is not to make the you feel competent (though it may do that as well) but to emphasize the rigors of your grueling task, preserving suspension of disbelief.

### 2.18.2 Costly Auto-Success

Your GM may use a costly success where failure offers no entertaining plot branches, but they still want you to work for victory. In a costly success, you succeed, but at a price.

Even if you suffer a defeat, you still overcome the story obstacle. You also, however, suffer a state of adversity to one or more abilities, in keeping with the defeat level, as per the Consequences of Defeat Table.

The state of adversity might apply, as in an ordinary contest, to the abilities you used in that contest. Usually, though, they apply to some other resource-related ability, which may come to haunt you later on. When in doubt, ask yourself if the penalty will cripple the group in dealing with contests

## 2.19 Advanced: Alternative Character Creation Methods

Two Advanced character creation methods are available. More detail on these methods are available in their own section.

### 2.19.1 The List Method

This is like the As-You-Go method but you spend all their points before the game begins. This is possible with the As-You-Go method as well, but the list method allows you to signal what they want the game to be about from the abilities you pick, as opposed to reacting to material once the game begins.

### 2.19.2 The Prose Method

This is the most different method as you write a piece of prose and the pulls abilities from that. It's intent is to emulate a character description in fiction, and indeed PCs can be built by copying text from a story and then identifying keywords. It is the least 'fair' of the character creation options.

## 2.7 Advanced Mechanics

You can play QuestWorlds with just the basic mechanics, and we recommend start with this simpler set of rules whilst your GM masters the less-familiar ideas like story obstacles instead of task resolution, that make QuestWorlds different from traditional RPGs.

The Advanced mechanics add detail to the Basic mechanics, which add detail, or generate in-game story developments, at the cost of more complexity.

## 2.8 Resolution Methods

An Advanced resolution method is available:

### 2.8.1 Long Contest

An Advanced rule, Long Contests, lets you zoom-in to task-level contests to play out struggling with a series of tasks in order to overcome the obstacle, such as blow-by-blow exchanges with the king's champion in front of the tower where your father is held hostage, or exposing the lies of a witness in the court room to free a wrongly accused innocent man.

Your GM should resolve most conflicts using the simple contest rules. However, every so often, your GM may want to stretch out the resolution, breaking it down into a series of actions. Your GM should do this when they want to give you a chance to make your PC shine, by focusing in on how they handle themselves in a difficult situation, and giving them a chance to show their range of abilities.

As a rule of thumb, if you want resolution that moves closer to the task level, a long contest may be appropriate.

A sequence of die rolls, between one or more PCs and one or more supporting characters, breaks the conflict resolution into a series of actions.

A Long Contest trades speed for detail. For the flow of a story we recommend using simple contests as much as possible. If you come from other roleplaying games that have task based contests, we recommend playing only using simple contests, until you have mastered the different approach of conflict based contests, before introducing Long Contests.

More details on Long Contests are available in their own section.

### 2.8.2 Escalating Contests

If your GM chooses Scored Contests form of Long Contest you can use an option called Escalating Contests.

Escalating Contests allow your GM to switch a Simple Contest to a Long Contest. To do this, simply re-interpret the Simple Contest results as the first round of a Scored Contest. For example, in a contest of magic at the Thaumaturgical Academy, Billiard, your PC, gains a Marginal Victory over his opponent Crowsky. The GM narrates the outcome, but although you get what you agreed, you want Crowsky to be humiliated. Your GM agrees to an Escalating Contest, treating the result as the first round of a Scored Contest, and scores 1 RP against Crowsky before beginning adjudication with the second round.

Escalating Contests can serve three functions:

* If you take part in a contest and after hearing the narrative feel aggrieved that you could not bring more abilities to bear, and the GM agrees that it would be interesting to let you shine for a moment, an escalating contest helps you bring more abilities into the contest.
* If you take part in a contest but the degree of success was not emotionally satisfying, an escalating contest gives you another chance to achieve the result you want.
* If your GM is unsure if a Simple or Long Contest is appropriate then they can default to a Simple Contest and switch to Escalating if required.

If your GM wishes to use Escalating Contests, they need to chose Scored Contests as the Long Contest option.

## 2.9 Resistance Progression

Your GM may decide that resistance to your actions gets harder, as the campaign progresses. This reflects the trope of the type of challenges you face getting tougher as you improve.

Your GM should mimic a TV show more where the resistance does not increase during a season of the show, allowing the protagonists to get more competent as the show progresses towards its climax. In the next season though the resistance usually goes up, and the writers reflect this with more challenging opposition in the new season of the show.

In that case your GM should bump the resistance by +3, +6 or +9 for the next campaign you play with the same characters. The size of the change should reflect the increase in your previous abilities in the last campaign. For example, if in the last season you increased your occupation keyword by +6, your GM may decide to increase the resistance by +3 or +6 to reflect the more challenging opposition in the new campaign. 

The GM should adjust the type of opposition you meet for a given resistance, to reflect your improvement. The palace guards who were a Moderate resistance in the last season might now be a Low resistance to maintain your PCs' fictional improvement. 

### 2.9.3 No Progression

Your GM may also decide that the resistances do not get harder as the campaign progresses, reflecting the PCs ability to disregard minor challenges, and simply choose harder resistances to challenge the players.

## 2.10 Degrees of Success

Often all you need to know to interpret the results of a resolution is whether you succeeded or failed.

Sometimes, you’ll want to know how well you succeeded, or how badly you failed. This may be important in providing consequences or benefits, that drive further story.

All of the resolution methods have an option to yield the degrees of success for the victor. The possible degrees of success, from least to greatest, are: marginal, minor, major, complete. Ties are also possible.

If you contest against NPCs or abstract forces, the interpretation of the results reveals whether you overcome the obstacle, and any consequences or benefits; your GM narrate the fate of the NPCS or other forces depending on what makes sense. However, when you and another PC engage in a contest then a success for one contestant means a corresponding failure for the loser.

So whilst in a PC vs. PC duel the PC would only be killed on a Complete Defeat, an NPC, described as a resistance, might be killed on any victory, depending on how the contest was framed.

**Tie**: Tie means no result. Effort was expended, but the net result is that nothing consequential occurs, or else both sides lose or gain equally. If this is confusing, and you are not contending with another PC, your GM can rule that you gain a Marginal Victory.

**Marginal Victory**: Yes, but… You get what you want, but there are complications, the effect is more limited than you desired, or you have to make a hard choice between benefits or accept a loss to get one

**Minor Victory**: Yes... You gets exactly what they want i.e. whatever was at stakes in the contest.

**Major & Complete Victory**: Yes, and… You get the stakes, and something else. You gain something, stealing a possession, gaining a new follower, or become renowned in song. If you want to distinguish a Complete the effect is often permanent and no new contests should be framed for this obstacle.

**Marginal Defeat**: No, but… You don't get what you want, you lose, but it’s not a total loss. You are able to salvage something from the defeat, a little more if you sacrifice something other than the prize to your opponent, that the opponents agrees to take instead.

**Minor Defeat**: No… You don't get what you want, you lose the stakes. Any consequences or complications such as injury or loss of influence are short term and easily shrugged off. Just take the loss and rest up.

**Major & Complete Defeat**: No and… You don’t get what you want, and there are long-term consequences. The situation might grow worse or more complicated or you might suffer adverse consequences that will require other conflicts to resolve: an injury that needs a healer, an insult that requires a formal apology, a loss of influence with the community that requires a triumph to win their trust again etc. You might be dead, or as good as. Or perhaps you lose something, an item is taken from you, a follower deserts you, your reputation lies in ruins as poets mock your defeat. If you want to distinguish, a Complete should be bigger loss than a Major, but you can ignore this distinction often.

Your GM will use the degree of success to determine any side effects or benefits and consequences, but be sure to describe the success in narrative terms.

If you are using a Stretch, then major or complete victories you score are instead treated as minor victories.

## 2.11 Benefits and Consequences

Contests, in addition to deciding whether you overcome an obstacle, carry additional side effects, or consequences. These are negative if you lose, and positive if you win.

Your GM may simply determine these from what makes fictional sense, given the agreed prize for the contest, as described above. Optionally your GM may impose Consequences of Defeat or provide Benefits of Victory if they desire ongoing penalties or bonuses. This rule is used in conjunction with Degrees of Success. Your GM should always respond to the flow of the story, if narrative consequences are enough, they should not reach for additional mechanical penalties.

### 2.11.1 The Consequences of Defeat

When you lose a contest, you may suffer consequences: literal or metaphorical injuries which make it harder for you to use related abilities.

* In a fight or test of physical mettle, you wind up literally wounded.
* In a social contest, you suffer damage to your reputation.
* If commanding a war, you lose battalions, equipment, or territories.
* In an economic struggle, you lose money, other resources, or opportunities.
* In a morale crisis, you may suffer bouts of crippling self-doubt.

From the least to the most punishing, the five states of adversity are: Hurt, Impaired, Injured, Dying, and Dead. The first four are possible results of any contest. Dying PCs become dead, unless they receive intervention of some sort.

Although the levels refer to physical states of well-being, the consequences can be emotional, social, spiritual, magical, and so on.

#### 2.11.1.2 Hurt

If you are hurt, you show signs of adversity and find it harder to succeed at contests related to your defeat. Either your flesh or pride may be bruised. Until you recover, you suffer a –3 penalty to all related abilities.

You may suffer multiple hurts to the same ability. These are cumulative until recovery occurs.

Unless your GM has a dramatic reason to decide otherwise, your hurts vanish at the end of a session, after one day of rest per accumulated hurt, or when in-game events justify their removal.

#### 2.11.1.3 Impaired

If you are Impaired, you have taken a jarring blow, physically, socially, or emotionally, and you are much likelier to fail when attempting similar actions in the future. You suffer a –6 penalty to all related abilities. Impairments combine with hurts and with other impairments.

As bad as your condition may be, there’s nothing wrong with you that some prolonged inactivity won’t fix. A single impairment goes away after one week of rest, or when an in-game event (like miraculous or extraordinary treatment) occurs to make their removal seem believable.

#### 2.11.1.4 Injured

If you are injured, you have suffered a debilitating blow which leaves you reeling. Physically you may have have lost the use of a limb or sense, socially you may be shunned, and emotionally you may in shock. Although you should heal with time, you suffer a -9 penalty to all related abilities. Injuries combine with impairments and hurts.

A single injury goes away after a month's rest, or by miraculous intervention, as above.

#### 2.11.1.5 Dying

If you are dying you will, without rapid and appropriate intervention, expire. To save you, the other PCs must overcome a story obstacle. Their attempt must be credible, using medicine or magic, as defined by your genre. Your GM should use a Very High resistance for this contest, unless the story suggests otherwise. According to the conventions of dramatic storytelling, the character typically has just enough time left for the other characters to make this one attempt.

Successful intervention leaves the PC injured. Depending on the narrative circumstances, a complete victory on the intervention attempt may leave them merely impaired.

If intervention fails, you will die, but not necessarily immediately. Although irrevocably doomed, your GM may rule that the story suggests that you survive long enough to take one final, heroic, action.

To even take that final action if the GM offers you the chance, then you must succeed at a prior contest of wherewithal to rouse yourself to action. Appropriate abilities for the contests of wherewithal include:

* Physical action: Endurance, High Pain Threshold, Grim Determination, etc.
* Intellectual activity: Concentration, Iron Will, Love Of Country (if action to be attempted is patriotic), etc.
* Social humiliation: Savoir Faire, Unflappable, Stoic Dignity

A contest of wherewithal faces a Moderate resistance. Even if you succeed at the contest of wherewithal, you take an automatic bump down whenever you use any related ability in a contest. (The bump down does not apply to the contest of wherewithal itself.) Where it seems apt, your GM may choose to ignore the bump down if you score a major or complete victory on the contest of wherewithal.)

Any active hurts or impairments continue to be counted against you as well.

Your final action cannot reverse the outcome of the contest that you lost, it must involve a new story obstacle. Your GM will rule if you action is allowable.

Like other states of adversity, dying may be literal or metaphorical. Your standing in society, business or politics may be on the brink of permanent extinction. You may be facing mental death — a permanent lapse into madness or senility.

#### 2.11.1.6 Dead

If you die as a result of physical injuries, you are gone from the game, period.

Death from a non-physical contest will likely be metaphorical. If you die in an economic, social, spiritual, or artistic contest, you permanently lose abilities.

Even only metaphorically dead, your GM may declare that you have undergone changes so dire as to make your PC unplayable. You may be incurably insane, or be so socially shamed that you retire to a life of obscurity or religious meditation. You may be shunned by all around you, sent into permanent exile, or sentenced to long-term imprisonment with no hope of escape.

### CONSEQUENCES OF DEFAT TABLE

|Defeat Level|State of Adversity|Penalty|
|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|
|Marginal|Hurt|–3 penalty to appropriate abilities|
|Minor|Impaired|–6 penalty to appropriate abilities|
|Major|injured|–9 penalty to appropriate abilities|
|Complete|Dying| No actions allowed. If 'final action', automatic bump down on uses of appropriate ability|

### 2.11.2 Benefits of Victory

Just as when you experience defeat you can suffer ongoing ill effects in addition to the loss of the prize at hand, when you win you can gain benefits from that victory.

A benefit of victory gives you a bonus on the selected abilities, or in the specified situation, as determined by your victory level.

* In a fight or test of physical mettle, your workout leaves you sharp for the next encounter.
* In a social contest, you gain confidence and admiration from your triumph.
* If commanding a war, you gain strategic advantage over your enemy.
* In an economic struggle, your profits can be re-invested, or you drive competitors into the ground.
* In a morale crisis, you are buoyed up by success, nothing can stop you now.

Remember that the benefit does not have to be directly related to the ability used. Look to the goal of the contest. The abilities or situation should reflect the story obstacle that was overcome and the tactics used to overcome it.

* In a fight or test of physical mettle, your triumph has everyone rallying to your cause.
* In a social contest, you win powerful allies who will strengthen your in your fight against your enemies.
* If commanding a war, you pillage the enemy city and enrich your army.
* In an economic struggle, you gain status as one of the wealthy elite.
* In a morale crisis, your rallied troops strengthen your army.

A PC may apply bonuses from multiple benefits to a single contest.

From the least to the most robust the four states of fortune are: Fresh, Pumped, Invigorated, and Heroic.

#### 2.11.2.1 Fresh

If you are Fresh, you are lively and find it easier to succeed at contests related to your victory. You are on a roll and feel confident and able. Until you are defeated, you gain a +3 bonus to all related abilities.

You may be refreshed multiple times on the same ability. These are cumulative until defeat occurs.

Unless your GM has a dramatic reason to decide otherwise, your freshness vanishes at the end of a session, after one day of idleness, or when in-game events justify their removal.

#### 2.11.1.3 Pumped

If you are Pumped, you are energized, physically, socially, or emotionally, and you are much likelier to succeed when attempting similar actions in the future. You gain a +6 bonus to all related abilities. Pumped combines with Fresh and Pumped.

As good as your condition may be, an extended period of idleness will cause you to lose your edge. A single Pumped goes away after one week of idleness, or when an in-game event (like long drunken party) occurs to make their removal seem believable.

#### 2.11.1.4 Invigorated

If you are Invigorated, you are pulsing with hormones, mentally focused, or exuding confidence. Physically you can push your body to new personal bests of achievement, socially confidant and exuding charisma, and emotionally you are in touch with your feelings and resonate with those of others. Although this will fade with time, you gain a +9 benefit to all related abilities. Invigorated combines with Pumped and Fresh.

Being Invigorated goes away after a month's idleness, or an in-game event, as above.

#### 2.11.1.5 Heroic

If you are heroic, you have become unstoppable, physically at peak performance, socially, everyone wants to be you or be with you, and emotionally you have gained new insights into yourself and others around you. Although this will fade with time, you gain a bump up to all related abilities. Heroic combines with invigorated, pumped and fresh.

Being heroic goes away after a season's idleness, or an in-game event, as above.

### BENEFITS OF VICTORY TABLE

|Victory Level|State of Fortune|Benefit|
|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|
|Marginal|Fresh|+3|
|Minor|Pumped|+6|
|Major|Invigorated|+9|
|Complete|Heroic|You receive an automatic bump up on uses of an appropriate ability|

#### 2.11.2.1 Clearly Inferior Opponents

Defeating clearly inferior opponents neither teaches you anything nor significantly enhances
your reputation; you are ineligible for a benefit of victory if the resistance you used in the contest exceeded the resistance by 6 or more. If, in the case of long contest, you or your opponent used multiple abilities, compare the best ability you used to his worst.

### 2.11.3 Recovery and Healing

Consequences of Injured or less lapse on their own with the passage of time. However, you’ll often want to remove them ahead of schedule, with the use of abilities.

#### 2.11.3.1 Healing Abilities

The ability used to bring about recovery from a state of adversity must relate to the type of harm.

You can heal physical injuries with medical or extraordinary abilities. 

You can remove mental traumas, including those of confidence and morale, with mundane psychology or through extraordinary abilities. You might also remove then through a dramatic confrontation between the victim and the source of the psychic injury.

You use social abilities to heal social injuries. You probably have to make a public apology of some sort, often including a negotiation with the offended parties and the payment of compensation, either in disposable wealth or something more symbolic.

You can fix damage to items and equipment with some sort of repair ability. If you want to fix an extraordinary item, you may require genre-specific expertise: a broken magic ring may require a ritual to reforge.

Your GM should almost always resolve healing attempts as simple contests. An exception might be a medical drama, in which surgeries would comprise the suspenseful set-piece sequences of the game, and your GM might chose an Long Contest.

#### 2.11.3.2 Healing Resistances

Default resistances to remove states of adversity are as follows:

### HEALING RESISTANCES TABLE

|Consequence of Defeat|Difficulty|
|:-------------:|:-------------:|
|Hurt|Low|
|Impaired|Moderate|
|Injured|High|
|Dying|Very High|

#### 2.11.3.3 Results of Healing

When you make a successful healing attempt, you remove one level of adversity for each level of victory. A major defeat increases the subject’s consequence of defeat by 1; a complete defeat adds an additional 2 levels to the consequence of adversity.

### 2.11.4 Waning Benefits

Just as you recover from consequences with time, or through healing, so benefits fade with time.

At the end of a storyline, especially when a significant period of game-world time passes between the conclusion of one episode and the beginning of the next, the GM may declare that all benefits have expired.

### 2.11.5 Benefits Meet Consequences

Because it is confusing to track both benefits and consequences against the same ability your GM may simply rule that one cancels the other out. This is particularly true of social contests where a moment of shame can erase your previous triumphs, or your confidence eroded by a failure. Physical benefits may cancel out, flushed with victory you may be able to ignore pain, but it may defy credibility for wounds to be healed by an athletic performance.

Your GM may simply rule that benefits and consequences cancel out, or they may take the difference between the two benefits and create a new one. For example if you are Invigorated by your previous performance in the dance contest, but then suffer a Hurt, your GM may rule that your twisted ankle cancels out your energy from the last performance, or your GM might rule that your success sees you through the pain, but you are now only Pumped.

## 2.11 Modifiers

Your ability rating represents a general ability to succeed in the narrative, but modifiers reflect specific conditions that may make it easier or harder to overcome particular obstacles. They are applied to your ability to get a final target number (TN).

Positive modifiers are called bonuses; negative modifiers are called penalties.

Positive modifiers, or bonuses, may raise your ability high enough to gain a mastery, in which case you get the bumps up or down that a mastery would normally supply.

Negative modifiers, or penalties, may lower an ability to the point where it loses one or more masteries. In this case, you lose the bumps up or down you would normally get.

Your GM should only use modifiers to alter your target number due to unusual circumstances you helped to create, or have some control over. If an unusual situation applies to a resistance, the GM should choose a resistance that reflects that. Modifiers never apply to the resistance.

If penalties reduce your target number to 0 or less, any attempt to use it automatically results in  failure. You must find another way to achieve his aim.

### 2.12.1 Stretches

When you propose an action using an ability that seems completely inappropriate, your GM rules it impossible. If you went ahead and tried it anyway, you’d automatically fail—but you won’t, because that would be silly.

In some cases, though, your proposed match-up of action and ability is only somewhat implausible. A successful attempt with it wouldn’t completely break the illusion of fictional reality—just stretch it a bit. 

Using a somewhat implausible ability is known as a stretch. If your GM deems an attempt to be a stretch, the PC suffers a -3, –6, -9, or -M penalty to their target number, depending on how inappropriate your stretch is. An ability that falls below a 0 target number cannot be used.

The definition of stretch is elastic, depending on genre.

Your GM should not impose stretch penalties on action descriptions that add flavor and variety to a scene, but do not fundamentally change what you can do with your ability. These make the scene more fun but don’t really gain any advantage.

### 2.12.2 Situational Modifiers

Your GM may also impose modifiers when, given the description of the current situation, believability demands that you should face a notable advantage or disadvantage. Your GM should choose modifiers of +6, +3, –3, or –6. Modifiers of less than 3 don’t exert enough effect to be worth the bother. Those higher than 6 give the situational modifier a disproportionate role in determining results.

During an Long Contest, they should typically last for a single exchange, and reflect clever or foolish choices.

### 2.12.3 Engaging Multiple Opponents

If you gang up on an opponent, they face a contest for each player. For each extra player, the resistance faces during a given round, your GM reduces the resistance by a cumulative -3 penalty.

Your GM should resolve all engagements against the resistance at once, adjusting the order of action as necessary. You can choose the order in which you engage your opponent. It’s usually smartest to engage them in order of relative toughness, from lowest to highest rating with the lowest rated PCs.

If you face multiple opponents your GM should use 2.14 Mobs, Gangs, and Hordes.

## 2.13 Combined Abilities

On certain occasions your GM may rule that you can only hope to achieve your goal by using two disparate abilities. When this occurs, average your two ability ratings, then apply any modifiers, to arrive at your TN.

Combining your abilities, rather than using the best one and augmenting it with other, is always a disadvantage. Your GM should only require combined ability use when story logic absolutely demands that you face a lower chance of success, because you have to do two things at once.

## 2.14 Mobs, Gangs, and Hordes

Sometimes you will face large numbers of individually inconsequential opponents. Your GM treats many as one. They divide the number of minor opponents by the number of contesting PCs. Your GM then treats each of these sections of the crowd as a single opponent with one ability rating. Their numbers are factored into the ability rating your GM assigns to them. 

When the mob loses an exchange, your GM describes individuals within it as being hurt or falling away. When it wins, describe them overwhelming you, or swelling in numbers.

## 2.15 Mass Effort

Clashes of massive forces resolve like any other contest, Simple or Long, solo or group. These include:

* Military engagements
* Corporate struggles for market share • Building competitions
* Efforts to spread a faith or ideology • Dance competitions

If you are not participating in the contest and have no stake in its outcome, then your GM doesn’t bother to run a contest. The GM just chooses an outcome for dramatic purposes.

Otherwise, your GM will start by determining your degree of influence over the outcome. They are either:

* Determining factors: The success of the effort depends mostly on your choices and successes. For example, you might be a military leader facing a force of roughly equal potency. As all else is equal, the better general will win the day. In this instance, your tactic should be a relevant leadership ability.
* Contributors: One of the forces enjoys a clear advantage over the others, but the your efforts may tip the balance in favor of a chosen side. Your GM will tell give you a TN to roll against that represents the strength of your force, but you can augment that TN with an appropriate leadership ability.
* Acted Upon: You have little influence over the outcome, but are stuck in the middle of the conflict and must struggle to prosper within it. The GM predetermines the outcome of the overall competition on dramatic grounds. To determine your fate in the battle, you contest against a resistance determined by the GM, derived from the overall battle outcome.

## 2.16 Pyrrhic Victories

In a Pyrrhic victory, you boost your chance of success in a contest by accepting negative consequence at its end, even if you succeed in overcoming the story obstacle. You gain a bump in the ability you are using to prosecute the contest, but at the contest’s end, you suffer a state of adversity, as per the Pyrrhic Victory Table.

As with any proposed action, you must convincingly describe the potentially suicidal risks
you are taking to achieve their objective. You must also show how these risks can bring you the awful victory they seek.

### PYRRHIC VICTORY CONSEQUENCES TABLE

|Outcome|State of Adversity|
|:-------------:|:-------------:|
|Any Defeat|Dead|
|Marginal Victory|Dead|
|Minor Victory|Dying|
|Major Victory|Injured|
|Complete Victory|Impaired|

## 2.17 Mismatched and Graduated Goals

Sometimes, the two sides in a contest may have goals that do not directly conflict one another. A huntsman pursues a nurse, who is trying to escape through the forest with two small children. The huntsman wants to kill the nurse. The nurse wants to save the children.

When encountering mismatched goals, your GM should determine whether the mismatch is complete, or partial.

In a complete mismatch, neither side is at all interested in preventing the other’s goal. A complete mismatch does not result in a contest; your GM asks what you are doing, and then describes each participant succeeding at their goals.

In most instances, the contest goals are not actually mismatched, but graduated. You have both a primary and a secondary goal. In this case, your GM frames the contest, identifying which goal is which. To achieve both, you must score a major or complete victory. On a minor or marginal victory, you achieve only the primary goal. Your GM may present you with the choice of which objective you obtain, where that choice illuminates your PC's priorities.

## 2.18 Difficult Auto-Success

Two distinct methods allow your GM to create a sense of difficulty without allowing for the prospect of failure: the arduous automatic success, and the costly success. Your GM will use a costly success where failure offers no entertaining plot branches, but when they still want the group to work for victory. In a costly success, you succeed, but at a price.

### 2.18.1 Arduous Auto-Success

Your GM will use an arduous automatic success to help with pacing. They will simply allow you to succeed without a contest, and then describe in sweat-inducing detail your hard-won victory. Unlike the standard automatic success, the objective here is not to make the you feel competent (though it may do that as well) but to emphasize the rigors of your grueling task, preserving suspension of disbelief.

### 2.18.2 Costly Auto-Success

Your GM may use a costly success where failure offers no entertaining plot branches, but they still want you to work for victory. In a costly success, you succeed, but at a price.

Even if you suffer a defeat, you still overcome the story obstacle. You also, however, suffer a state of adversity to one or more abilities, in keeping with the defeat level, as per the Consequences of Defeat Table.

The state of adversity might apply, as in an ordinary contest, to the abilities you used in that contest. Usually, though, they apply to some other resource-related ability, which may come to haunt you later on. When in doubt, ask yourself if the penalty will cripple the group in dealing with contests.

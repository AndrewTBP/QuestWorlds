## 2.7 Advanced Mechanics

You can play *QuestWorlds* with just the basic mechanics and we recommend you start with this simpler set of rules whilst your GM masters the less-familiar ideas like **story obstacles** instead of task resolution, that make *QuestWorlds* different from traditional RPGs.

The advanced mechanics add detail to the Basic mechanics, which add detail, or generate in-game story developments, at the cost of more complexity.

## 2.8 Resolution Methods

### 2.8.1 Long Contest

Your GM should resolve most conflicts using the **simple contest** rules. However, every so often, your GM may want to stretch out the resolution, breaking it down into a series of actions.

An advanced rule, **long contests**, lets you zoom-in to task-level in **contests** to focus on your character struggling with a series of tasks in order to overcome the **story obstacle**, such as blow-by-blow exchanges with the king's champion in front of the tower where your father is held hostage, or exposing the lies of a witness in the court room to free a wrongly accused innocent man. Your GM should do this when they want to give you a chance to make your PC shine, by focusing in on how they handle themselves in a difficult situation, and giving them a chance to show their range of abilities.

As a rule of thumb, if you want resolution that moves closer to the task level, a **long contest** may be appropriate.

A sequence of die rolls, between one or more PCs and one or more **supporting characters**, breaks the conflict resolution into a series of actions.

A **long contest** trades speed for detail. For the flow of a story we recommend using **simple contest**s as much as possible. If you come from other roleplaying games that have task based **contests**, we recommend playing only using **simple contests**, until you have mastered the different approach of conflict based **contests**, before introducing **long contests**.

More details on **long contests** are available in §5.

### 2.8.2 Escalating Contests

If your GM chooses either the **scored contests** or **chained contests** form of **long contest** you can use an option called **escalating contests**.

**Escalating contests** allow your GM to switch a **simple contest** to a **long contest**. To do this, simply re-interpret the **simple contest outcome** as the first **round** of a **scored contest** or **chained contest**. For example, in a **contest** of magic at the Thaumaturgical Academy, Billiard, your PC, gains a **marginal victory** over their opponent Crowsky. The GM narrates the **outcome**, but although you get what you agreed, you want Crowsky to be humiliated. Your GM agrees to **escalating contest**, treating the **outcome** as the first **round** of a **scored contest**, and scores 1 **RP** against Crowsky before beginning adjudication with the second **round**.

**Escalating contests** can serve three functions:

* If you take part in a **contest** and after hearing the narrative feel aggrieved that you could not bring more **abilities** to bear, and the GM agrees that it would be interesting to let you shine for a moment, an escalating **contest** helps you bring more **abilities** into the **contest**.
* If you take part in a **contest** but the degree of **success** was not emotionally satisfying, an escalating **contest** gives you another chance to achieve the **outcome** you want.
* If your GM is unsure if a **simple or long contest** is appropriate then they can default to a **simple contest** and switch to **escalating** if required.

If you wish to use **escalating contests**, you need to choose **scored contests** as your **long contest** option.

## 2.9 Resistance Progression

Your GM may decide that **resistance** to your actions gets harder, as the campaign progresses. This reflects the trope of the type of challenges you face getting tougher as you improve.

Your GM should adopt a strategy that mimics a TV show where the **resistance** does not increase during a season of the show, allowing our protagonists to get more competent as the show progresses towards its climax. In the next season though the **resistance** usually goes up, and the writers reflect this with more challenging opposition in the new season of the show. At the same time, the opposition that was tough in the first season, now become mooks that can be easily dispatched to show the increased competence of the protagonists.

In that case your GM should increment the **resistance** by +3, +6 or +9 for the next campaign you play with the same characters. The size of the change should reflect the increase in your previous **abilities** in the last campaign. For example, if in the last season you increased your **occupation keyword** by +6, your GM may decide to increase the **resistance** by +3 or +6 to reflect the more challenging opposition in the new campaign. Your GM should also take into account that the opposition you were improving with respect to in the previous season should now be considered more-easily defeated mooks, and use lower **ratings** for them when they appear in the story.

### 2.9.1 No Progression

Your GM may also decide that the **resistances** do not get harder as the campaign progresses, reflecting the PCs **ability** to disregard minor challenges, and simply choose harder **resistances** to challenge the players.

## 2.10 Degree of Victory or Defeat

Often all you need to know to interpret the **outcome** of a resolution is whether you gained **victory** or suffered a **defeat**.

Sometimes, you’ll want to know how great a **victory** you won, or how bad a **defeat** you endured. This may be important in providing **consequences or benefits** that drive further story.

All of the resolution methods have an option to yield the **Degree of Victor or Defeat** for the PC. The possible **Degree of Victory or Defeat**, from least to greatest, are: **marginal**, **minor**, **major**, **complete**. **Ties** are also possible.

If you struggle against NPCs or abstract forces, the interpretation of the **outcome** reveals whether you overcome the **story obstacle**, and any **consequences or benefits**; your GM narrates the fate of the NPCs or other forces depending on what makes sense. However, when you and another PC engage in a **contest** then a **victory** for one contestant means a corresponding **defeat** for the loser.

So whilst in a PC vs. PC duel the PC would only be killed on a **complete defeat**, an NPC, described as a **resistance**, might be killed on any **victory**, depending on how the **contest** was framed.

**Tie**: Tie means no **outcome**. Effort was expended, but the net **outcome** is that nothing consequential occurs, or else both sides lose or gain equally. If this is confusing, and you are not contending with another PC, your GM can rule that you gain a **marginal victory**.

**Marginal Victory**: Yes, but… You get what you want, the **prize**, but there are complications, the effect is more limited than you desired, or you have to make a hard choice between benefits or accept a loss to get one

**Minor Victory**: Yes... You get exactly what they want i.e. whatever was the **prize** in the **contest**.

**Major & Complete Victory**: Yes, and… You get the **prize**, and something else. You gain something, stealing a possession, gaining a new **follower**, or become renowned in song. If you want to distinguish a **complete** the effect is often permanent and no new **contests** should be framed for this **story obstacle**.

**Marginal Defeat**: No, but… You don't get what you want, you lose the **prize**, but it’s not a total loss. You are able to salvage something from the **defeat**, a little more if you sacrifice something other than the **prize** to your opponent, that the opponent agrees to take instead.

**Minor Defeat**: No… You don't get what you want, you lose the **prize**. Any consequences or complications such as injury or loss of influence are short term and easily shrugged off. Just take the loss and rest up.

**Major & Complete Defeat**: No and… You don’t get what you want,  you lose the **prize**, and there are long-term consequences. The situation might grow worse or more complicated or you might suffer adverse consequences that will require other conflicts to resolve: an injury that needs a healer, an insult that requires a formal apology, a loss of influence with the community that requires a triumph to win their trust again etc. You might be dead, or as good as. The **prize** is likely lost to you permanently. Or perhaps you lose something, an item is taken from you, a **follower** deserts you, your reputation lies in ruins as poets mock your defeat. If you want to distinguish, a **complete** should be bigger loss than a **major**, but you can often ignore this distinction.

Your GM will use the **degree of success** to determine any **benefits and consequences**, but be sure to describe the **success** in narrative terms.

If you are using a **stretch**, see §2.12.1, then **major or complete victories** you obtain are instead treated as **minor victories**.

## 2.11 Benefits and Consequences

**Contests**, in addition to deciding whether you overcome a **story obstacle**, carry additional **consequences**. These are negative if you lose, and positive if you win.

Your GM may simply determine these from what makes fictional sense, given the agreed **prize** for the **contest**, as described above. Optionally your GM may impose **consequences of defeat** or provide **benefits of victory** if they desire ongoing **penalties** or **bonuses**. This rule is used in conjunction with **degree of victory or defeat**. Your GM should always respond to the flow of the story, if narrative consequences are enough, they should not reach for additional mechanical **penalties**.

### 2.11.1 The Consequences of Defeat

When you lose a **contest**, you may suffer **consequences**: literal or metaphorical injuries which make it harder for you to use related **abilities**.

* In a fight or test of physical mettle, you wind up literally wounded.
* In a social contest, you suffer damage to your reputation.
* If commanding a war, you lose battalions, equipment, or territories.
* In an economic struggle, you lose money, other resources, or opportunities.
* In a morale crisis, you may suffer bouts of crippling self-doubt.

From the least to the most punishing, the five **states of adversity** are: **hurt**, **impaired**, **injured**, **dying**, and **dead**. The first four are possible **consequences** of any **contest**. **Dying** PCs become **dead**, unless they receive intervention of some sort.

Although the levels refer to physical **states of adversity**, the consequences can be emotional, social, spiritual, magical, and so on.

#### 2.11.1.2 Hurt

If you are **hurt**, you show signs of adversity and find it harder to succeed at **contests** related to your **defeat**. Either your flesh or pride may be bruised. Until you recover, you suffer a –3 **penalty** to all related **abilities**.

You may suffer multiple **hurts** to the same **ability**. These are cumulative until recovery occurs.

Unless your GM has a dramatic reason to decide otherwise, your **hurts** vanish at the end of a session, after one day of rest per accumulated **hurt**, or when in-game events justify their removal.

#### 2.11.1.3 Impaired

If you are **impaired**, you have taken a jarring blow, physically, socially, or emotionally, and you are much likelier to fail when attempting similar actions in the future. You suffer a –6 **penalty** to all related **abilities**. Impairments combine with **hurts** and with other impairments.

As bad as your condition may be, there’s nothing wrong with you that some prolonged inactivity won’t fix. A single **impairment** goes away after one week of rest, or when an in-game event (like miraculous or extraordinary treatment) occurs to make their removal seem believable.

#### 2.11.1.4 Injured

If you are **injured**, you have suffered a debilitating blow which leaves you reeling. Physically you may have lost the use of a limb or sense, socially you may be shunned, and emotionally you may in shock. Although you should heal with time, you suffer a -9 **penalty** to all related **abilities**. Injuries combine with impairments and **hurts**.

A single **injury** goes away after a month's rest, or by miraculous intervention, as above.

#### 2.11.1.5 Dying

If you are **dying** you will, without rapid and appropriate intervention, expire. To save you, the other PCs must overcome a **story obstacle**. Their attempt must be credible, using medicine or magic, as defined by your genre. Your GM should use a **very high resistance** for this **contest**, unless the story suggests otherwise. According to the conventions of dramatic storytelling, the character typically has just enough time left for the other characters to make this one attempt.

Successful intervention leaves the PC **injured**. Depending on the narrative circumstances, a **complete victory** on the intervention attempt may leave them merely **impaired**.

If intervention fails, you will die, but not necessarily immediately. Although irrevocably doomed, your GM may rule that the story suggests that you survive long enough to take one final, heroic, action.

To even take that **final action** if the GM offers you the chance, then you must succeed at a prior **contest of wherewithal** to rouse yourself to action. Appropriate abilities for the **contest of wherewithal** include:

* Physical action: Endurance, High Pain Threshold, Grim Determination, etc.
* Intellectual activity: Concentration, Iron Will, Love of Country (if action to be attempted is patriotic), etc.
* Social humiliation: Savoir Faire, Unflappable, Stoic Dignity

A **contest of wherewithal** faces a **moderate resistance**. Even if you succeed at the **contest of wherewithal**, you take an automatic **bump** down **penalty** whenever you use any related **ability** in a **contest**. (The **bump** down does not apply to the **contest of wherewithal** itself.) Where it seems apt, your GM may choose to ignore the **bump** down if you score a **major or complete victory** on the **contest of wherewithal**.)

Any active **hurts** or **impairments** continue to be counted against you as well.

Your **final action** cannot reverse the **outcome** of the **contest** that you lost, it must involve a new **story obstacle**. Your GM will rule if your action is allowable.

Like other **states of adversity**, **dying** may be literal or metaphorical. Your standing in society, business or politics may be on the brink of permanent extinction. You may be facing mental death — a permanent lapse into madness or senility.

#### 2.11.1.6 Dead

If you die as a consequence of physical injuries, you are gone from the game, period.

Death from a non-physical **contest** will likely be metaphorical. If you die in an economic, social, spiritual, or artistic **contest**, you permanently lose abilities.

Even only metaphorically dead, your GM may declare that you have undergone changes so dire as to make your PC unplayable. You may be incurably insane, or be so socially shamed that you retire to a life of obscurity or religious meditation. You may be shunned by all around you, sent into permanent exile, or sentenced to long-term imprisonment with no hope of escape.

### CONSEQUENCES OF DEFEAT TABLE

|Defeat Level|State of Adversity|Penalty|
|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|
|Marginal|Hurt|–3 penalty to appropriate abilities|
|Minor|Impaired|–6 penalty to appropriate abilities|
|Major|injured|–9 penalty to appropriate abilities|
|Complete|Dying| No actions allowed. If 'final action', automatic **bump** down on uses of appropriate **ability**|

### 2.11.2 Benefits of Victory

Just as when you experience **defeat** you can suffer ongoing ill effects in addition to the loss of the **prize** at hand, when you win you can gain benefits from that **victory**.

A **benefit of victory** gives you a bonus on the selected **abilities**, or in the specified situation, as determined by your **victory** level.

* In a fight or test of physical mettle, your workout leaves you sharp for the next encounter.
* In a social contest, you gain confidence and admiration from your triumph.
* If commanding a war, you gain strategic advantage over your enemy.
* In an economic struggle, your profits can be re-invested, or you drive competitors into the ground.
* In a morale crisis, you are buoyed up by success, nothing can stop you now.

Remember that the **benefit** does not have to be directly related to the **ability** used. Look to the goal of the **contest**. The abilities or situation should reflect the **story obstacle** that was overcome and the **tactic** used to overcome it.

* In a fight or test of physical mettle, your triumph has everyone rallying to your cause.
* In a social contest, you win powerful **allies** who will strengthen you in your fight against your enemies.
* If commanding a war, you pillage the enemy city and enrich your army.
* In an economic struggle, you gain status as one of the wealthy elite.
* In a morale crisis, your rallied troops strengthen your army.

A PC may apply **bonuses** from multiple **benefits** to a single **contest**.

From the least to the most robust the four **states of fortune** are: **fresh**, **pumped**, **invigorated**, and **heroic**.

#### 2.11.2.1 Fresh

If you are **fresh**, you are lively and find it easier to succeed at **contests** related to your **victory**. You are on a roll and feel confident and able. Until you are **defeated**, you gain a +3 **bonus** to all related abilities.

You may be refreshed multiple times on the same **ability**. These are cumulative until **defeat** occurs.

Unless your GM has a dramatic reason to decide otherwise, your **freshness** vanishes at the end of a session, after one day of idleness, or when in-game events justify their removal.

#### 2.11.1.3 Pumped

If you are **pumped**, you are energized, physically, socially, or emotionally, and you are much likelier to succeed when attempting similar actions in the future. You gain a +6 **bonus** to all related abilities. **Pumped** combines with **fresh** and **pumped**.

As good as your condition may be, an extended period of idleness will cause you to lose your edge. A single **pumped** goes away after one week of idleness, or when an in-game event (like long drunken party) occurs to make their removal seem believable.

#### 2.11.1.4 Invigorated

If you are **invigorated**, you are pulsing with hormones, mentally focused, or exuding confidence. Physically you can push your body to new personal bests of achievement, socially confidant and exuding charisma, and emotionally you are in touch with your feelings and resonate with those of others. Although this will fade with time, you gain a +9 **bonus** to all related abilities. **Invigorated** combines with **pumped** and **fresh**.

Being **invigorated** goes away after a month's idleness, or an in-game event, as above.

#### 2.11.1.5 Heroic

If you are **heroic**, you have become unstoppable, physically at peak performance, socially, everyone wants to be you or be with you, and emotionally you have gained new insights into yourself and others around you. Although this will fade with time, you gain a **bump** **bonus** to all related abilities. Being **heroic** combines with **invigorated**, **pumped** and **fresh**.

Being **heroic** goes away after a season's idleness, or an in-game event, as above.

### BENEFITS OF VICTORY TABLE

|Victory Level|State of Fortune|Benefit|
|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|
|Marginal|Fresh|+3|
|Minor|Pumped|+6|
|Major|Invigorated|+9|
|Complete|Heroic|You receive an automatic **bump** up on uses of an appropriate **ability**|

#### 2.11.2.1 Clearly Inferior Opponents

Defeating clearly inferior opponents neither teaches you anything nor significantly enhances your reputation; you are ineligible for a **benefit of victory** if the **resistance** you used in the **contest** exceeded the **resistance** by 6 or more. If, in the case of a **long contest**, you or your opponent used multiple **abilities**, compare the best **ability** you used to their worst.

### 2.11.3 Recovery and Healing

Consequences of **injured** or less lapse on their own with the passage of time. However, you’ll often want to remove them ahead of schedule, with the use of **abilities**.

#### 2.11.3.1 Healing Abilities

The **ability** used to bring about recovery from a **state of adversity** must relate to the type of harm.

You can heal physical injuries with medical or extraordinary **abilities**.

You can remove mental traumas, including those of confidence and morale, with mundane psychology or through **extraordinary abilities**. You might also remove them through a dramatic confrontation between the victim and the source of the psychic injury.

You use social abilities to heal social injuries. You probably have to make a public apology of some sort, often including a negotiation with the offended parties and the payment of compensation, either in disposable wealth or something more symbolic.

You can fix damage to items and equipment with some sort of repair **ability**. If you want to fix an extraordinary item, you may require genre-specific expertise: a broken magic ring may require a ritual to reforge.

Your GM should almost always resolve healing attempts as **simple contests**. An exception might be a medical drama, in which surgeries would comprise the suspenseful set-piece sequences of the game, and your GM might chose a **long contest**.

#### 2.11.3.2 Healing Resistances

Default **resistances** to remove states of adversity are as follows:

### HEALING RESISTANCES TABLE

|Consequence of Defeat|Difficulty|
|:-------------:|:-------------:|
|Hurt|Low|
|Impaired|Moderate|
|Injured|High|
|Dying|Very High|

#### 2.11.3.3 Outcomes of Healing

When you make a successful healing attempt, you remove one level of **adversity** for each level of **victory**. A **major defeat** increases the subject’s **consequences of defeat** by 1; a **complete defeat** adds an additional 2 levels to the **state of adversity**.

### 2.11.4 Waning Benefits

Just as you recover from **consequences** with time, or through healing, so **benefits** fade with time.

At the end of a storyline, especially when a significant period of game-world time passes between the conclusion of one episode and the beginning of the next, the GM may declare that all **benefits** have expired.

### 2.11.5 Benefits Meet Consequences

Because it is confusing to track both **benefits and consequences** against the same **ability** your GM may simply rule that one cancels the other out. This is particularly true of social **contest**s where a moment of shame can erase your previous triumphs, or your confidence eroded by a **failure**. Physical benefits may cancel out, flushed with victory you may be able to ignore pain, but it may defy credibility for wounds to be healed by an athletic performance.

Your GM may simply rule that **benefits** and **consequences** cancel out, or they may take the difference between the two benefits and create a new one. For example if you are **invigorated** by your previous performance in the dance **contest**, but then suffer a **hurt**, your GM may rule that your twisted ankle cancels out your energy from the last performance, or your GM might rule that your success sees you through the pain, but you are now only **pumped**.

## 2.12 Modifiers

Your **rating** represents a general **ability** to succeed in the narrative, but modifiers reflect specific conditions that may make it easier or harder to overcome particular **story obstacles**. They are applied to your **ability** to get a final **target number** (**TN**).

Positive modifiers are called **bonuses**; negative modifiers are called **penalties**.

**Bonuses**, may raise your **ability** high enough to gain a **mastery**, in which case you get the **bumps** up or down that a **mastery** would normally supply.

**Penalties**, may lower an **ability** to the point where it loses one or more **masteries**. In this case, you lose the **bumps** up or down you would normally get.

Your GM should only use modifiers to alter your **target number** due to unusual circumstances you helped to create, or have some control over. If an unusual situation applies to a **resistance**, the GM should choose a **resistance** that reflects that. Modifiers never apply to the **resistance**.

If **penalties** reduce your **target number** to 0 or less, any attempt to use it automatically **results** in  **failure**. You must find another way to achieve your aim.

### 2.12.1 Stretches

When you propose an action using an **ability** that seems completely inappropriate, your GM rules it impossible. If you went ahead and tried it anyway, you’d automatically fail—but you won’t, because that would be silly.

In some cases, though, your proposed match-up of action and **ability** is only somewhat implausible. A successful attempt with it wouldn’t completely break the illusion of fictional reality—just stretch it a bit.

Using a somewhat implausible **ability** is known as a **stretch**. If your GM deems an attempt to be a **stretch**, the PC suffers a -3, –6, -9 **penalty**, or a **bump** down, to their **target number**, depending on how incredible the **stretch** seems to the GM and other players. Your GM should **penalize** players who try to create a 'do anything' **ability** that they then **stretch** to gain from raising fewer **abilities** in advancement to ensure balance with other PCs.

A default **stretch penalty** should be -6.

The definition of **stretch** is elastic, depending on genre.

Your GM should not impose **stretch penalties** on action descriptions that add flavor and variety to a scene, but do not fundamentally change what you can do with your **ability**. These make the scene more fun but don’t really gain any advantage.

### 2.12.2 Situational Modifiers

Your GM may also impose **modifiers** when, given the description of the current situation, believability demands that you should face a notable **bonus** or **penalty**. Your GM should choose **modifiers** of +6, +3, –3, or –6. **Modifiers** of less than 3 don’t exert enough effect to be worth the bother. Those higher than 6 give the situational **modifier** a disproportionate role in determining **outcomes**.

During a **long contest**, they should typically last for a single **round**, and reflect clever or foolish choices.

## 2.13 Combined Abilities

On certain occasions your GM may rule that you can only hope to achieve the **prize** by using two disparate **abilities**. When this occurs, average your two **ability ratings**, then apply any modifiers, to arrive at your **TN**.

Combining your abilities, rather than using the best one and **augmenting** it with other, is always a disadvantage. Your GM should only require combined **ability** use when story logic absolutely demands that you face a lower chance of **success**, because you have to do two things at once.

## 2.14 Mobs, Gangs, and Hordes

Sometimes you will face large numbers of opponents. Your GM can treat many as one. Your GM divides the number of opponents by the number of contesting PCs. Your GM then treats each of these sections of the crowd as a single opponent with one **rating**. Their numbers are factored into the **rating** your GM assigns to them.

If in doubt, your GM should think of the **resistance** that would be dramatically appropriate for a single opponent and then adjust it with a **bonus** of +3, +6 or +9 depending on how outnumbered you are. No more than six foes can typically contend with you in a physical confrontation, or two in a social one, or they tend to get in each other's way.

When the mob loses an exchange, your GM describes individuals within it as being hurt or falling away. When it wins, describe them overwhelming you, or swelling in numbers.

## 2.15 Ganging Up

Sometimes you may outnumber your opponent. For a **simple contest** this can be often be handled by having your PC on point, and the other PCs **augmenting** you, breaking the usual rule on multiple **augments** if more than one person should be able to support you. Your GM may only allow as many of you to **augment** as they feel would help, not get in each other's way. For a **group contest, long or simple** if you enjoy a numerical advantage you should separately contest against a reduced **resistance**. Your GM should adjust the **resistance** to reflect your superior numerical advantage.

As above, if in doubt, the GM should think of the **resistance** that would be dramatically appropriate for a one-on-one confrontation and then adjust it with a **penalty** of -3, -6, or -9 depending on how significantly you outnumber them. As above, note that unless your opponent is extraordinarily large, you cannot confront them physically with more than about six people (include **followers**) or socially with about two people (again include **followers**) or people just get in each other's way.

## 2.16 Mass Effort

Clashes of massive forces resolve like any other **contest**, **simple** or **long**. These include:

* Military engagements
* Corporate struggles for market share • Building competitions
* Efforts to spread a faith or ideology • Dance competitions

If you are not participating in the **contest** and have no stake in its **outcome**, then your GM doesn’t bother to run a **contest**. The GM just chooses an **outcome** for dramatic purposes.

Otherwise, your GM will start by determining your degree of influence over the **outcome**. They are either:

* Determining factors: The success of the effort depends mostly on your choices and successes. For example, you might be a military leader facing a force of roughly equal potency. As all else is equal, the better general will win the day. In this instance, your **tactic** should be a relevant leadership **ability**.
* Contributors: One of the forces enjoys a clear advantage over the others, but your efforts may tip the balance in favor of a chosen side. Your GM will give you a **TN** to roll against that represents the strength of your force, but you can **augment** that **TN** with an appropriate leadership **ability**.
* Acted Upon: You have little influence over the **outcome**, but are stuck in the middle of the conflict and must struggle to prosper within it. The GM predetermines the **outcome** of the overall competition on dramatic grounds. To determine your fate in the battle, you **contest** against a **resistance** determined by the GM, derived from the overall battle **outcome**.

## 2.17 Pyrrhic Victories

In a Pyrrhic victory, you **boost** your chance of **success** in a **contest** by accepting negative consequence at its end, even if you succeed in overcoming the **story obstacle**. You gain a **bump** in the **ability** you are using to prosecute the **contest**, but at the **contest**’s end, you suffer a **state of adversity**, as per the Pyrrhic Victory Table.

As with any proposed action, you must convincingly describe the potentially suicidal risks you are taking to achieve their objective. You must also show how these risks can bring you the **victory** they seek.

### PYRRHIC VICTORY TABLE

|Outcome|State of Adversity|
|:-------------:|:-------------:|
|Any Defeat|Dead|
|Marginal Victory|Dead|
|Minor Victory|Dying|
|Major Victory|Injured|
|Complete Victory|Impaired|

## 2.18 Mismatched and Graduated Goals

Sometimes, the two sides in a **contest** may have goals that do not directly conflict one another. A huntsman pursues a nurse, who is trying to escape through the forest with two small children. The huntsman wants to kill the nurse. The nurse wants to save the children.

When encountering **mismatched goals**, your GM should determine whether the mismatch is complete, or partial.

In a **complete mismatch**, neither side is at all interested in preventing the other’s goal. A **complete mismatch** does not end in a **contest**; your GM asks what you are doing, and then describes each participant succeeding at their goals.

In most instances, the **contest** goals are not actually **mismatched**, but **graduated**. You have both a **primary** and a **secondary** goal. In this case, your GM frames the **contest**, identifying which goal is which. To achieve both, you must score a **major or complete victory**. On a **minor or marginal victory**, you achieve only the **primary** goal. Your GM may present you with the choice of which objective you obtain, where that choice illuminates your PC's priorities.

## 2.19 Difficult Automatic Victory

Two distinct methods allow your GM to create a sense of difficulty without allowing for the prospect of **failure**: the **arduous automatic victory**, and the **costly automatic victory**. Your GM will use a **costly automatic victory** where **failure** offers no entertaining plot branches, but when they still want the group to work for victory. In a **costly automatic victory**, you succeed, but at a price.

### 2.19.1 Arduous Automatic Victory

Your GM will use an **arduous automatic victory** to help with pacing. They will simply allow you to succeed without a **contest**, and then describe in sweat-inducing detail your hard-won **victory**. Unlike the standard **automatic victory**, the objective here is not to make you feel competent (though it may do that as well) but to emphasize the rigors of your grueling task, preserving suspension of disbelief.

### 2.19.2 Costly Automatic Victory

Your GM may use a **costly automatic victory** where **failure** offers no entertaining plot branches, but they still want you to work for **victory**. In a **costly automatic victory**, you succeed, but at a price.

Even if you suffer a **defeat**, you still overcome the **story obstacle**. You also, however, suffer a **state of adversity** to one or more **abilities**, in keeping with the **defeat** level, as per the **consequences of defeat** table.

The **state of adversity** might apply, as in an ordinary **contest**, to the abilities you used in that **contest**. Usually, though, they apply to some other resource-related **ability**, which may come to haunt you later on. When in doubt, ask yourself if the **penalty** will cripple the group in dealing with **contests**.

# 7.0 Hero Points and Experience Points

During play your PC will earn **experience points (XP)**. **XPs** can be used to improve your character. But during a session, before you add your **XPs** to an **experience point pool** with which you can purchase an **improvement package** you can also **burn** them for a boost in a contest. Burning an **XP** gains you a **bump**. You can also **burn** an **XP** on a **plot edit**. Because only **XPs** gained within the session can be used for a **bump** within that session, we call them **hero points (HP)** . At the end of the session of play, unspent **HP** become **XP**

To summarize:

* At the beginning of a session you have 0 **hero points**.
* During the session you may be awarded **hero points** (see ยง7.1.1).
* During the session you may **burn** one **hero point** to **bump** your own roll, or on a **plot edit**.
* At the end of a session, unspent **hero points** become **experience points** on a one-for-one basis and are added to your **experience point pool** (see ยง7.1.2)
* When your **experience point pool** has sufficient points, you may use them to purchase an improvement (see ยง7.2)
* When you spend **experience points** to purchase an **improvement package** they are subtracted from your pool.

# 7.0 Hero Points and Experience Points

During play your PC will earn **experience points**. **Experience Points** can be used to improve your character. But during a session, before you add your **experience points** to an **experience point pool** with which you can purchase an **improvement package** you can also **burn** them for a boost in a contest. Burning a **experience point** earned in that session gains you a **bump** (see §2.3.7). You can also **burn** an **experience point** gained that session for a **plot edit** (see §7.3). Because only **experience points** gained within the session can be used for a **bump** or **plot edit** within that session, we call them **hero points (HP)** to make them easy to track. At the end of the session of play, unspent **hero points** become **experience points**.

To summarize:

* At the beginning of a session you have 0 **hero points**.
* During the session you may be awarded **hero points** (see §7.1.1).
* During the session you may **burn** one **hero point** to **bump** your own roll, or on a **plot edit**.
* At the end of a session, unspent **hero points** become **experience points** on a one-for-one basis and are added to your **experience point pool** (see §7.1.2)
* When your **experience point pool** has sufficient points, you may use them to purchase an **improvement package** (see §7.2)
* When you spend **experience points** to purchase an **improvement package** they are subtracted from your pool.

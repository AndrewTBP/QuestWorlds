## 5.7 Extremely Long Contests

There’s no particular time scale associated with **contests**. But some **contests** may by their very nature be a drama that can’t be resolved at one point in the narrative. Examples include political campaigns, construction projects, or seductions. These can be resolved by **long contests** where each **round** is conducted at an appropriate moment, rather than sequentially. Your GM will need to keep track of the **resolution or advantage points** and the **resistance**, though this might change as the context changes (a civil war started by the players could impede their castle-building plans). The challenges of each round will vary, and you may use a different **ability** or **augment** in the next exchange.

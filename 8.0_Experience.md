## 8.0 Experience

During a session of play your character will have the chance to learn from experience or overcoming personal obstacles. When your character learns, they gain a **experience points**. **Experience points** can be used to improve your character.

### 8.0.1 Earning Experience Points

You gain one **experience points** for any of the following:

* When your **result** for using an ability is a **failure** in a **simple contest**. 
* When you suffer your first **failure** in a **long contest** you gain an **experience point**. You do not gain any **experience points** for subsequent **failures** in a **long contest**, even if you switch **ability**. 
* You gain a **experience point** when your GM uses a **flaw** or other **ability** against you in a contest with you as per the chapter Flaws (see ยง3.4). This happens either when the story forced you to confront a **flaw**, or the GM gave you a **hindrance** (see ยง3.4). You only gain an **experience point** from a **hindrance** if it results in a **penalty**. You can only gain an **experience point** from an individual **flaw** or **ability** being used against you once per session. Repeated confrontations with the same **flaw** or **ability** in the same session do not teach you anything new.

You do not gain **experience points** if any of the following apply:

* You can only gain one **experience point** from any source for a **contest** be that **hindrance** or **failure**.
* You only gain one **experience point** the first time your **result** is a **failure** to use that ability in a session; repeated **failures** to use the same ability teach you nothing else and you gain no further **experience points** for that **ability** until the next session.
* If you **bump** your **result**, through a **mastery** or **story point**, you do not gain a **experience point** for that **contest**. This negates any already earned for that **contest**.
* You do not learn from a **fumble** and so you do not gain a **experience points** when you **fumble**.
* You do NOT gain an **experience point** from an **assured contest**, even if you roll to determine **benefits** or **consequences**.

You can gain a maximum of five **experience points** in any one session. Once you have earned five **experience points**, you cannot gain further **experience points** in that session. You should usually expect to earn less, and may earn none.

Note that if you have a **mastery** in your **ability**, you will need to contend against a **resistance** that also has a **mastery** to learn by a **failure**. When **masteries** 'cancel out', you can once again roll a **failure** result giving you the opportunity to learn. You may also choose to use **abilities** that do not have a **mastery** even if an **ability** with a **mastery** could apply, as **failure** with them will lead to your gaining a **experience point**.

As your **ability** ratings improve, you will gain fewer **experience points**, and you will improve your **abilities** less frequently, unless you take on greater challenges. This is by design. Your GM should craft stories that provide greater challenges to experienced PCs to allow them the opportunity to earn **experience points**.

Burning a **story point** to gain a **bump** prevents you from gaining an **experience point** from that **contest**. Sometimes you may need to trade-off between a **failure** from which you can learn, and a **success** which brings you closer to your goal. In part, this rule exists to dissuade you from always seeking to spend a **story point** to edit out a **failure**.

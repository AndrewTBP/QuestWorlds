# [Option] Extended Contest
Most conflicts should be resolved using the simple contest rules. However, every so often, you’ll want to stretch out a resolution, breaking it down into a series of smaller actions, increasing the suspense the players feel as they wait to see if they succeed or fail.

## Procedure
1. Frame the contest.
2. Figure the PC's target number (TN) using the ability rating and any modifiers. The PCs TN is the rating of their ability, plus or minus modifiers the GM may give the PC. 
3. The GM determines the resistance. The GM opposes the PC with a resistance—the harder the task or tougher the opponent, the higher the resistance.
4. Carry out one or more rounds, repeating as necessary.
    1. An extended contest unfolds as a series of simple contests. At the end of each simple contest, the winning character (or resistance) scores a number of resolution points (RPs) to his tally, which varies between 1 and 5, depending on the result. Tied results leave the score unchanged.
    2. The number of resolution points the winner garners at the end of each exchange depends on the degree of victory he scored. He gets 1 point for a marginal victory, 2 for a minor victory, 3 for a major victory, and 5 for a complete victory. 
    3. The first of the contesting characters to accumulate a total of 5 points wins; his opponent is knocked out of the contest and loses the prize.
5. Determine Degee of Succes based on Rising Action of Climax (below).
6. Determine Benefits of Victory or Consequences of Defeat. 
7. Describe the result based on the agreed prize.

### Rising Action 
Rising action refers to all of the many plot events and complications that occur between the beginning and the climax of a story. During this phase of your story, use the Rising Action Consequence table to assess results.

Find the difference between the winner and loser’s resolution point scores as of the contest’s conclusion, and cross-reference with the following table to find the severity of lasting consequences suffered by the loser. 

GROUP SIMPLE CONTEST RESULTS TABLE

|5|Injured|3|2|
|6|Injured|3|2|
|7|Dying|3|2|
|8|Dead|3|2|
|9|Dead|3|2|


### Climax
For the final, climactic confrontation that wraps up your story, use the following, more punishing method of doling out consequences. 

Take into account all resolution points scored against all participants. Winners and losers alike add up all resolution points scored against them by any opponent. Then the losers add 1 to their totals. The result is then cross-referenced against the Climactic Scene Consequence table.

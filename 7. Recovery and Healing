# Recovery and Healing
Consequences of Injured or less lapse on their own with the passage of time. However, you’ll often want to remove them ahead of schedule, with the use of abilities.

## Healing Abilities
The ability used to bring about recovery from a state of adversity must relate to the type of harm sustained by the victim.

Physical injuries can be healed by medical abilities. 

Mental traumas, including those of con dence and morale, may be removed with mundane psychology or through extraordinary abilities. They might also be removed through a dramatic confrontation between the victim and the source of the psychic injury.

Social injuries must be healed through social abilities. They probably require public expiation of some sort, often including a negotiation with the offended parties and the payment of reparations, either tangible or symbolic.

Damage to items and equipment requires some sort of repair ability. Extraordinary items may require genre-specific expertise: a broken magic ring may require a ritual to reforge.

Healing attempts will almost always unfold as simple contests. An exception might be a medical drama, in which surgeries would comprise the suspenseful set-piece sequences of the game.

## Resistances
Default resistances to remove states of adversity are as follows:

 HEALING RESISTANCES TABLE
| | |
| ------------- | ------------- |
|Consequence of Defeat|Difficulty|
|Hurt|Low|
|Impaired|Moderate|
|Injured|High|
|Dying|Very High|

## Consequences of Healing
A successful healing attempt removes one level of adversity for each level of victory. A major defeat increases the subject’s consequence of defeat by 1; a complete defeat adds an additional 2 levels to the consequence of adversity.

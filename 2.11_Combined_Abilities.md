## 2.11 Combined Abilities

On certain occasions your GM may rule that you can only hope to achieve the **prize** by using two disparate **abilities**. When this occurs, average your two **ability ratings**, then apply any modifiers, to arrive at your **TN**.

Combining your abilities, rather than using the best one and **augmenting** it with other, is always a disadvantage. Your GM should only require combined **ability** use when story logic absolutely demands that you face a lower chance of **success**, because you have to do two things at once.

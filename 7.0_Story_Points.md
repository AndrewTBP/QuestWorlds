# 7.0 Story Points 

At the beginning of play, your GM will create a **story point pool** for your group. The **story point pool** has one **story point** per PC. During play you can **burn** a point from this pool, after which it is lost. When you **burn** a **story point** you can edit the story in your PC or group's favor. You can either do this to improve your **result** via a **bump** (see ยง7.1) or to introduce a helpful fact into the world via a **plot edit** (see $7.2).

You can decide to spend one of your group's **story points** from the **pool** at any time. You do not agreement from the other players to do so.

## 7.0.1 Refreshing Story Points

Because you burn a **story point** to use it, your **story point pool** may become exhausted. The GM has three alternative strategies for refreshing your **pool:**

* The **story point pool** refreshes at the beginning of every session of play.
* The **story point pool** refreshes whenever your PCs engage in genre-appropriate downtime. Usually the GM plays this out as a montage, asking your character to describe genre appropriate activities in this time period.
* The **story point pool** refreshes whenever the GM deems it necessary, based on their desire to allow you to edit the upcoming story.

Ultimately your GM is always the arbiter of how the **story point pool** refreshes. You may never have more **story points** in the pool, than a total of one **story point** per PC.

## 7.0.2 Player vs. Player

In games with a strong player vs. player element, your GM should dispense with **story points** as they become disruptive if used against each other.

## 7.0.3 Story Point Pool Summary

To summarize:

* At the beginning of a session you have 1 **story points** per PC in the pool.
* During the session you may **burn** one **story point** to **bump** a PC's roll (see ยง7.1),
* During the session you may **burn** one or more **story points**  on a **plot edit**.
* **Story points** that are burned are lost from the **story point pool**.
* The GM decides on the conditions to a refresh a **story point pool**.
* The **story point pool** never refreshes beyond the maximum of 1 **story points** per PC in the pool.

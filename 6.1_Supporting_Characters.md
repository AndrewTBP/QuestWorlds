## 6.1 Supporting Characters

Many relationships connect you to NPCs controlled by the GM.

When you try to use one of these relationships to solve a problem, your **tactic** is your relationship **ability**. You can’t simply go to the **supporting character** you have a relationship with, stick them with the problem, and expect to see it solved.

If you succeed, the **supporting character** helps you solve the problem. If you fail, they don’t. As with any **ability**, you must still specify how the NPC goes about overcoming the **story obstacle** or answering the **story question**. Calls on relationships are almost always **simple contests**.

In crucial situations, it may seem dramatically inappropriate for you to solve a problem indirectly, by working through others. Your GM can expose the **supporting character** to serious risk. If the character dies or otherwise suffers a change of status that renders them useless to you, you permanently lose the relationship **ability**.

Before putting **supporting characters** at serious risk, your GM should make sure the players understand the magnitude of the possible consequences.

When **supporting characters** undertake significant risk, the **supporting character** may suffer a **consequence of defeat** commensurate with the level of the **defeat** in the **contest**. Or it may simply be your relationship that is damaged or destroyed.

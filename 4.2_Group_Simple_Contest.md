## 4.2 Group Simple Contest

In the **group simple contest**, multiple participants take part in a **simple contest**. Each of you in your group conducts an individual **simple contest** against the GM, and the **outcomes** for each side are collated to determine the victor.

A **group simple contest** may pit all of you against a single **resistance**, representing one **story obstacle**.  Alternatively, a **group simple contest** may be a series of paired match-ups between two groups of contestants. If you are forced to participate in more than one **contest**, then you face the standard multiple opponent **penalties**.

### 4.2.1 Procedure

1. Your GM **frames the contest**.
2. You choose a **tactic**, and figure your PC's **target number** (**TN**) using the **score** and any **modifiers**. Your **TN** is the **score** of their **ability**, plus or minus **modifiers** the GM may give you.
3. Your GM determines the **resistance**.  If two PCs contend, your opponent figures their **TN** as described in step 2.
4. For each of your group, roll a D20 to determine your **success or failure**, then apply any **bumps**. Your GM does the same for the **resistance**. Compare your rolled number with your **TN** to see how well you succeeded or failed with your **ability**. Remember to apply any **bumps** from **masteries** or **story points**.
5. The side with the highest number of **victories** is the overall victor in the **contest**. Award **experience points** if appropriate (see ยง8.1).
6. Describe the **outcome** based on the agreed **prize**.

It is possible that you suffer a **defeat**, even though your side gains the **victory**. It is possible that, as a result, that your PC will suffer a **consequence of defeat** (see ยง2.7) related to your **defeat**, even though your side won. If your side loses, then you may suffer both a **consequence of defeat** for your own individual **contest**, and a **consequence of defeat** for the overall **contest**. That may simply be a worsening of the **consequence of defeat**.

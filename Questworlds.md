# Introduction
Questworlds is a roleplaying rules engine suitable for play in any genre.  Its abstract resolution methods and scalable character levels make it equally suitable to any genre, from epic fantasy to satirical soap opera. 

# Version
The first version of these rules Hero Wars was published in 2000 (ISBN 978-1-929052-01-1)

The second version HeroQuest was published in 2003 (ISBN 978-1-929052-12-7). We refer to this as HeroQuest 1e to disambiguate.

The third version HeroQuest: Core Rules was published in 2009 (ISBN 978-0-977785-32-2). We refer to this as HeroQuest 2e.

HeroQuest Glorantha was published in 2015 (ISBN 978-1-943223-01-5). It is the version of the rules in HeroQuest 2e, presented for playing in Glorantha. Some sources refer to it as HeroQuest 2.1e.

Questworld was published as a System Reference Document (SRD) (this document) in 2018. The version of the rules here is slightly updated, mainly to clarify ambiguities, from the version presented in HeroQuest 2e and HeroQuest 2.1e.

An Appendix lists changes in this version. As the SRD is updated we will continue to track version changes there.

# Why Questworlds?

Questworlds is meant to facilitate your creativity—and then to get out of your way. It is well suited to a collaborative, friendly group with a high degree of trust in each other’s creativity. If the members of your group are often at odds and rely on their chosen rules kit as an arbiter between competing visions of how the game ought to develop, Questworlds is not the rules set you need. Stick with your more structured system of choice.

# Participants
## Players
Each player creates a character or PC. The PCs pursue various goals in an imaginary world. 

## GM
The Games Master (GM), portrays the imaginary world in which the PCs live. The GM controls other people and creatures, or non-player characters, in this fictional environment. 

# Game Mechanics
Stories consist of a series of obstacles, which the heroes must overcome in order to reach their final goal.

A player’s encounter with a plot obstacle presents a conflict which must be resolved, either as a success or a failure. 

Whenever the characters try to overcome a difficult obstacle, the GM decides how difficult it will be. The player chooses an ability relevant to the conflict at hand, describes exactly what the PC is trying to accomplish, and how. The PCs success or failure, as determined by die rolls, changes the direction of the story, in either a big or small way.

### Optional Mechanics
We flag some mechanics as Advanced. The Questworlds engine is intended to be rules-lite, so we distinguish between the core mechanics, and options. Previous presentations included all the rules and whilst they suggested some were optional in the text were not explicit in tagging those rules. To make this SRD as flexible as possible we want to highlight which mechanics are optional; [Option] indicates a rule that can be ommitted in a presentation of the rules here. 

## Abilities
Anything that a character can use to solve problems or overcome obstacles in a story can be an ability. The player decides how to describe abilities. Some abilities, such as a PC's central area of expertise, can be very broad, entailing a wide variety of related capabilities. Others might be very colorful and specific, granting a PC advantages when entering into a conflict with an opponent using a less directly applicable ability.

### Masteries
Questworld abilities are scored on a range of 1–20, but are scalable. When you raise a rating of 20 by one point, it increases not to 21, but to 1M. The M signifies a game abstraction called a mastery. You have now reached a new order of excellence in that ability.

As you progress, you may gain multiple masteries. Multiple mastery is marked with a number to the right of the M symbol. If you have 10M2, you have two masteries. 10M3 means that you have three masteries, and so on. 

Questworlds genre packs may use symbols relevant to that genre to denote mastery, instead of M.

### [Option] Hero Points
Each character starts the game with a pool of 3 hero points, and gains more of them at the end of every session. These are a precious resource, as they are used both to boost characters’ contest results, and to improve abilities over the long term. 

## Procedure
The player chooses an ability relevant to the conflict at hand, describes exactly what his character is trying to accomplish, and how. The GM may modify these suggested actions to better fit the fictional circumstances, and describes the actions of the characters or forces on the other side of the conflict. 

### Resolution Methods
The available resolution methods are as follows:

#### Automatic Success
The PC simply succeeds. This may indicate that failure would not be interesting (such as finding an important clue, and the PC has an ability that it is credible could help to uncover that clue), or that failure would make the PC appear to be incompetent at a trivial or simple task for someone with that skill (such as a hunter bringing in the evening meal in a forest filled with game animals).

#### Simple Contest
The player rolls a 20-sided die; the GM does the same. 

The GM compares the two results, and determines success or failure. Armed with this knowledge, they describes the outcome of the conflict, and any consequences to either participant.

If players enter into conflict with one another, each rolls dice, and the GM interprets the results, as usual.

#### [Option] Extended Contest
A sequence of die rolls, between one or more PCs and one or more supporting characters, breaks the conflict resolution into a series of actions. This method trades speed for detail. 

All contest types can resolve the actions of multiple characters acting at once, on either side of the conflict.

## Framing the Contest
Contests in HeroQuest are more abstract than resolution methods in most other roleplaying games. They don’t simply tell you how well a PC succeeded at a particular task: they tell you whether or not the PC achieved their goal.

The player(s) taking part in the contest and the GM start by clearly agreeing on 1) what prize is up for grabs and 2) what tactics they’re using to try to get it. This process is called framing the contest.

Naming the prize: GMs start framing the contest by asking the involved player(s) what prize they’re trying to win, or what goal they’re hoping to achieve.

• This may be a literal prize, like a gold cup, a gun, or a briefcase full of money.

• More often the prize is a metaphorical one, like access to a location—a treasure vault or the database servers containing the secret plans.

• In a struggle for resources, the winner gets control of something: a seat in government, a supply of goods, the assistance of an ally.

• In a fight, the prize may be the opponents themselves, who the PCs are  fighting to capture or kill. (Just as often they’ll be seeking another goal and must incapacitate enemy combatants to get it. In this case, beating the enemy is the tactic, not the prize.)

• The stakes may be defensive in nature, as when the PCs try to stop supporting characters from doing something harmful, like dropping a bomb on a city, or assassinating the king.

### No Repeat Attempts
A contest represents all of a PCs attempts to overcome an obstacle. If a PC is defeated it means that no matter how many times they tried to solve the problem with their ability, the finally had to give up. THey can try again only if they apply a new ability to the task or the GM agrees that special circumstances exist.

## Default Ratings
If a PC enters a contest for which they have no relevant ability whatsoever, their base target number is a 6. Like ability ratings, it may be subject to modifiers.

## Modifiers
Where an ability rating represents a general ability to succeed in the narrative, modifiers reflect specific conditions that may make it easier or harder to overcome particular obstacles. They are applied to your ability to get a final target number (TN).

Positive modifiers are called bonuses; negative modifiers are called penalties.

Positive modifiers, or bonuses, may raise an ability high enough to gain a mastery, in which case the character gets the bumps up or down that a mastery would normally supply.

Negative modifiers, or penalties, may lower an ability to the point where it loses one or more masteries. In this case, the character loses the bumps up or down he would normally get.

Modifiers should only be used to alter a PC’s target number to respect unusual circumstances he helped to create, or has some control over. If an unusual situation applies to a resistance, change the resistance number. 

If penalties reduce a target number to 0 or less, any attempt to use it automatically results in  failure. The character must find another way to achieve his aim.

### Stretches
When you propose an action using an ability that seems completely inappropriate, the GM rules it impossible. If you went ahead and tried it anyway, you’d automatically fail—but you won’t, because that would be silly.

In some cases, though, your proposed match-up of action and ability is only somewhat implausible. A successful attempt with it wouldn’t completely break the illusion of  fictional reality—just stretch it a bit. 

Using a somewhat implausible ability is known as a stretch. If the GM deems an attempt to be a stretch, the PC suffers a –6 penalty to their target number. 

The definition of stretch is elastic, depending on genre. 

GMs should not impose stretch penalties on action descriptions that add  flavor and variety to a scene, but do not fundamentally change what the character can do with his ability. These make the scene more fun but don’t really gain any advantage.

### Situational Modifiers
GMs may also impose modifiers when, given the description of the current situation, believability demands that a character should face a notable advantage or disadvantage. Assess modifiers of +6, +3, –3, or –6. Modi ers of less than 3 don’t exert enough statistical effect to be worth the bother. Those higher than 6 give the situational modi er a disproportionate role in determining results.

During an extended contest, they should typically last for a single exchange, and reflect clever or foolish choices by the character. 

### Specific Ability Bonuses
Questworlds encourages players to be creative about their choice of their PC's abilities, but this creates tension between narrow and broadly defined abilities.

When two PCs contest and one has a broadly defined ability than the PC with a specific ability should gain either a +3 or +6 modi er, with the higher modifier reflecting a larger gap between the specificity of the two abilities.

## Resistance
The GM chooses a Resistance to represent the difficulty of the obstacle.

Resistance numbers are derived from a base number, which is modified according to the resistance class, as per the following table:

RESISTANCE CLASS TABLE
| | |
| ------------- | ------------- |
|Class|Value|
|Nearly Impossible|Base +M2|
|Very High|Base +M|
|High|Base +6|
|Moderate|Base|
|Low|Base -6|
|Very Low|Base -M or 6, whichever is lower|
 
By default, the base starts at 14. 

All contests use the base number + resistance class, except for contests to determine augments. Augmenting always faces a Moderate resistance—this is always the unmodified base value

### [Option] Resistance Progression
After two sessions of play, the base resistance increases by 1. After every subsequent two-session interval, it increases by another point. 

GMs may prefer other progression schemes that reflect the rate of advancement in their game, such as every four sessions of play (used in Heroquest 2.1e), or even every campaign.

## Die Rolls
To determine how well a PC uses an ability, roll a 20-sided die (d20). At the same time, the GM rolls for the resistance.

Compare the rolled number with the target number to determine the level of success or failure. 

* Critical: If the die roll is 1 (even when the target number is 1), the PC succeeds so brilliantly that the GM may reward them with an extra, unexpected effect.
* Success: If the die roll is greater than 1 and less than or equal to the target number, the PC succeeds, but there is nothing remarkable about the success.
* Failure: If the die roll is greater than the target number but not 20, the PC fails. Things do not happen as hoped.
* Fumble: If the die roll is 20, the PC fumbles (even when the target number is 20). This is the worst result possible, and the PC will suffer a disturbing or entertaining catastrophe. 

## Victory or Defeat
The degree of success or failure of the PC and GM’s rolls are compared.

If the PC has a better result than the resistance the PC has a victory and they gain the prize set out when the contest was framed. 

If the PC has a worse result they are defeated and do not gain the prize.

If the PCs both have the same level success or failure, the better roll wins.

if the PCs tie, then it is a standoff.

The GM describes what happens, based on their interpretation of the results.

### Better Roll
Questworlds supports two options for the 'better roll' the highest roll, or the lowest roll. Some groups prefer lowest roll, some higher. The preference toward 'low is better', is often because because 1 is a critical and 20 a fumble, and toward 'high is better' because the winner has rolled a higher number. Groups wanting higher abilities to win out slightly more often should use higher roll. Groups who use higher roll is better may also want to make 1 a Fumble and a critical rolling the Target Number exactly.

### Confusing Ties
Most tied results are easy to describe—as inconclusive standoffs, in which neither participant gets what they wanted.

In some situations, ties become difficult to visualize. Chief among these are contests with binary outcomes, where only two possible results are conceivable.

The GM can either change the situation on such a tie, introducing a new element that likely renders the original prize irrelevant to both pariticipants, or resolve the ties in favor of the PC. 

### Bumps
A bump affects the degree of success or failure of the die roll. A bump up improves the result by one step, changing a fumble to a failure, a failure to a success, or a success to a critical. Bump ups come from two sources: masteries and hero points (applied in that order). A bump down reduces the degree of success of your opponent. Bump downs come from one source: masteries.

### Bump Up with Mastery
If you’re engaged in a contest against a resistance, and you have an ability of 10M versus a resistance of 10, you enjoy an advantage. 

Opposed masteries cancel out, each contestant reducing their rating by the same number of masteries until only one or neither of them has masteries. A character with two masteries enjoys the same great advantage over one with a single mastery as a character with one mastery has over an opponent with no masteries. If you have an advantage of two or more masteries over an opponent, you can pretty much count on pounding him into the dust.

You get one bump up for each level of mastery your PC has greater than your opponent’s. 

### [Option] Bump Up with Hero Points
You can spend a hero point to bump up any result by one step. You may only bump your own rolls, not those of PCs or supporting characters—with the exception of sidekicks and retainers, which, as extensions of your characters, you may spend hero points on. You can decide to use a hero point for a bump after the die roll results are calculated (including any bump ups resulting from masteries

### [Option] Degrees of Success
Often all you need to know to interpret the results of a resolution is whether the character succeeded or failed. 

Sometimes, you’ll want to know how well a PC succeeded, or how badly he failed. This may be important in providing consequences or benefits, that drive futher story.

All of the resolution methods yield degrees of success for the victor. The possible degrees of success, from least to greatest, are: marginal, minor, major, complete. Ties are also possible. 

If a PC contests against NPCs or abstract forces, the interpretation of the results reveals whether the PC gains the prize, and any consequences or benefits for the PC, and the GM narrate the fate of the NPCS or other forces depending on what makes sense. However, when two PC are engaged in a contest then a success for one contestant means a corresponding failure for the loser.

So whilst in a PC vs. PC duel the PC would only be killed on a Complete Defeat, an NPC, described as a resistance, might be killed on any victory, depending on how the prize was framed.

**Tie**: Tie means no result. Effort was expended, but the net result is that nothing consequential occurs, or else both sides lose or gain equally. If this is confusing, the PC gains a Marginal Victory.

**Marginal Victory**: Yes, but… The PC gets what they want, but there are complications, the effect is more limited than they desired, or they have to make a hard choice between benefits or accept a loss to get one

**Minor Victory**: Yes... The PC gets exactly what they want i.e. the stakes. 

**Major & Complete Victory**: Yes, and… The PC get the stakes, and something else. The PC gains something, stealing a possession, gaining a new follower, or become renowned in song. If you want to distinguish a Complete the effect is often permanent and no new contests should be framed for this prize. 

**Marginal Defeat**: No, but… The PC doesn't get what they want, they lose, but it’s not a total loss. They are able to salvage something from the defeat, a little more if they sacrifice something other than the prize to their opponent, that the opponents agrees to take instead.

**Minor Defeat**: No… They don't get what they want, they lose the stakes. Any consequences or complications such as injury or loss of influence are short term and easily shrugged off. Just take the loss and rest up.

**Major & Complete Defeat**: No and… You don’t get what you want, and there are long-term consequences. The situation might grow worse or more complicated or you might suffer adverse consequences that will require other conflicts to resolve: an injury that needs a healer, an insult that requires a formal apology, a loss of influence with the community that requires a triumph to win their trust again etc. You might be dead, or as good as. Or perhaps you lose something, an item is taken from you, a follower deserts you, your reputation lies in ruins as poets mock your defeat. If you want to distinguish, a Complete should be bigger loss than a Major, but you can ignore this distinction often. 

Use the degree of success to determine any side effects or lingering consequences, but be sure to describe the success in narrative terms.

If the is using a Stretch, then major or complete victories they might score are instead treated as minor victories.

### [Option] Consequences
Contests, in addition to deciding whether the character gets the prize he was after, carry additional side effects, or consequences. These are negative if the character loses, and positive if he wins.

The GM may simply determine these from what makes fictional sense, given the agreed prize for the contest, as described above. Optionally the GM may impose Consequences of Defeat or provide Benefits of Victory if they desire ongoing penalties or bonuses. This rule is used in conjuction with Degrees of Success. The GM should always respond to the flow of the story, if narrative consequences are enough, don't reach for additional mechanical penalties. 

### The Consequences of Defeat
When heroes lose contests, they may suffer consequences: literal or metaphorical injuries which make it harder for the heroes to use related abilities.

• In a fight or test of physical mettle, heroes wind up literally wounded.
• In a social contest, they may suffer damage to their reputations.
• If commanding a war, they lose battalions, equipment, or territories.
• In an economic struggle, they lose money, other resources, or opportunities.
• In a morale crisis, heroes may suffer bouts of crippling self-doubt.

From the least to the most punishing, the five levels of consequences are: Hurt, Impaired, Injured, Dying, and Dead. The first four are possible results of any contest. Dying heroes become dead, unless they receive intervention of some sort. 

#### Healthy
PCs who aren’t in a state of adversity at all are considered healthy.

It is possible to seem banged up without suffering any measurable penalties. If you get into an extended contest during which you were at a disadvantage for a long time and  nally came from behind for the win, you may seem bruised, winded, anxious, or otherwise the worse for wear. Although this apparent harm may yield you useful sympathy, it doesn’t actually slow you down at all.

#### Dazed
In some situations, the Narrator may rule that a character is dazed. They are conscious but unable to initiate actions of their own. If another character engages them in a contest, they can snap out of it and defend themselves.

#### Hurt
A hurt PC shows signs of adversity and finds it harder to succeed at contests related to their defeat. Either their flesh or pride may be bruised. Until the PC recovers, they suffer a –3 penalty to all related abilities.

Characters may suffer multiple hurts to the same ability. These are cumulative until recovery occurs.

Unless the GM has a compelling dramatic reason to decide otherwise, hurts vanish at the end of a session, after one day of rest per accumulated hurt, or when in-game events justify their removal.

#### Impaired
An Impaired PC has taken a jarring blow, physically, socially, or emotionally, and is much likelier to fail when attempting similar actions in the future. THey suffers a –6 penalty to all related abilities. Impairments combine with hurts and with other impairments.

As bad as the character’s condition may be, there’s nothing wrong with him that some prolonged inactivity won’t fix. A single impairment goes away after one week of rest, or when an in-game event (like miraculous or extraordinary treatment) occurs to make their removal seem believable.

#### Injured
An injured PC  has suffered a debilitating shock to the system, one which renders them all but helpless.

To even participate in a contest, they must succeed at a prior contest of wherewithal to rouse themself to action. Appropriate abilities for contests of wherewithal might include:

• Physical action: Endurance, High Pain Threshold, Grim Determination, etc.
• Intellectual activity: Concentration, Iron Will, Love Of Country (if action to be attempted is patriotic), etc.
• Social humiliation: Savoir Faire, Un appable, Stoic Dignity

A contest of wherewithal faces a Moderate resistance. Even if the injured PC succeeds at the contest of wherewithal, they take an automatic bump down whenever they use any related ability in a contest. (The bump down does not apply to the contest of wherewithal itself.) Where it seems apt, the GM may choose to ignore the bump down if the PC scores a major or complete victory on the contest of wherewithal.

Any active hurts or impairments continue to be counted against him as well.

#### Dying
A dying PC will, without rapid and appropriate intervention, soon expire. To save them, the PCs must typically overcome a story obstacle and/or succeed at a difficult contest. According to the conventions of dramatic storytelling, the character typically has just enough time left for the other characters to make this one attempt.

Successful intervention leaves the PC injured. Depending on the narrative circumstances, a complete victory on the intervention attempt may leave them merely impaired.

If intervention fails, the character will die, but not necessarily immediately. Although irrevocably doomed, they may survive long enough to deliver a poignant final speech.The PC is unable to perform any task complicated enough to require a contest.

Like other states of adversity, dying may be literal or metaphorical. Your standing in society, business or politics may be on the brink of permanent extinction. You may be facing mental death—a permanent lapse into madness or senility. 

#### Dead
A PC who dies as a result of physical injuries is gone from the game, period. 

Death from a non-physical contest will likely be metaphorical. If you die in an economic, social, spiritual, or artistic contest, you permanently lose abilities.

Even only metaphorically dead, the GM may declare that the PC has undergone changes so dire as to make them unplayable. They may be incurably insane, or so socially shamed that they retire to a life of obscurity or religious meditation. They may be shunned by all around them, sent into permanent exile, or sentenced to long-term imprisonment with no hope of escape.

CONSEQUENCES OF DEFAT TABLE
| | | |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
|Defeat Level|State of Adversity|Penalty|
|Marginal|Hurt|–3 penalty to appropriate abilities| 
|Minor|Impaired|–6 penalty to appropriate abilities|
|Major|injured|Automatic bump down on uses of appropriate ability|
|Complete|Dying| No actions allowed|

## Benefits of Victory
Just as heroes who suffer defeat can suffer ongoing ill effects in addition to the loss of the prize at hand, heroes who win can gain extra benefits of victory.

The PC gets a bonus on the selected abilities, or in the specified situation, as determined by their victory level. The bonus remains until the PC suffers a defeat on a contest using either the bonus or the ability with which they won the original contest. A PC can’t decline the bonus because they might lose it; they must always use it in any contest in which it ought, in the GM’s judgment, to apply.

At the end of a storyline, especially when a significant period of game-world time passes between the conclusion of one episode and the beginning of the next, the GM may declare that all benefits of victory have expired.

A PC may apply bonuses from multiple benefits to a single contest.

# Simple Contests
## Procedure
1. Frame the contest.
2. Figure the PC's target number (TN) using the ability rating and any modifiers. The PCs TN is the rating of their ability, plus or minus modifiers the GM may give the PC. 
3. The GM determines the resistance. The GM opposes the PC with a resistance—the harder the task or tougher the opponent, the higher the resistance.
4. Roll a d20 to determine the PCs degree of success or failure, then apply any bumps. The GM does the same for the resistance. Compare your rolled number with your TN to see how well you succeeded or failed with your ability. Remember to apply any bumps from masteries or hero points.
5. Determine victory or defeat
    1. [Optional] Determine level of victory or defeat. Compare the PCs success or failure with the GM’s on the Simple Contest Results table. It is possible for a character to succeed at their die roll but still be defeated.
    2. [Optional] Determine consequences. 
6. Describe the result based on the agreed prize.

* In a group simple contest (see below), the Game Master may declare that both contestants suffer a Marginal Defeat to indicate that, although their results cancel out with respect to each other, their situation worsens compared to other contestants.

# Appendix
## Version Changes
### Version 2.2
* Flagged some rules that are not required, as optional to allow those using the SRD to safely omit them if not required.
* Clarified that contest results are only reciprocal between PCs. When the contest is against a resistance set by the GM, the results indicate whether the PC gains the prize, and the GM narrates the result for the resistance based on this.
* Rephrased the contest results to emphasise: Yes, No, And..., But..., This change is designed to dissuade GMs from misunderstanding that the prize is obtained on a marginal victory, one of the most common result types, and instead encourage GMs to allow PCs to fail forward on such a result by introducing downstream complications.
* Provided clarity that consequences of defeat and benefit of victory are optional and the GM should focus on using the prize to narrate the outcome of a contest, only applying mechanical benefits if they make sense.

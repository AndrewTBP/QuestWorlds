# Introduction

 Questworlds is a roleplaying rules engine suitable for play in any genre.  Its abstract resolution methods and scalable character levels make it equally suitable to any genre, from epic fantasy to satirical soap opera. 

## Why Questworlds?

Questworlds is meant to facilitate your creativity—and then to get out of your way. It is well suited to a collaborative, friendly group with a high degree of trust in each other’s creativity. If the members of your group are often at odds and rely on their chosen rules kit as an arbiter between competing visions of how the game ought to develop, Questworlds is not the rules set you need. Stick with your more structured system of choice.

### Players
Each player creates a character or PC. The PCs pursue various goals in an imaginary world. 

### Narrator
The Games Master (GM) or Narrator, portrays the imaginary world in which the PCs live. The Narrator controls other people and creatures, or non-player characters, in this fictional environment. 

### A Session
The players describe how their PCs pursue their goals; the Narrator challenges them by putting obstacles in their path. Sometimes these barriers to success come in the form of supporting characters who oppose them; at other times, they’re impersonal physical or mental challenges, like a lock that must be picked or a cliff the characters have to climb. Whenever the characters try to overcome a difficult obstacle, the Narrator decides how difficult it will be. Using numbers attached to their abilities, the players roll dice to see if they prevail. The Narrator rolls dice to represent the resistance posed by whatever challenge they face. Their success or failure, as determined by the die rolls, changes the direction of the story, in either a big or small way.

Although some games last for only an evening, it is typical for one group to play a series of stories involving the same characters and setting over a period of time. We refer to them collectively as a series, or sometimes a campaign.

# Overcoming Obstacles
## Conflicts
Stories consist of a series of obstacles, which the heroes must overcome in order to reach their final goal.
A player’s encounter with a plot obstacle presents a conflict which must be resolved, either as a success or a failure. 

## Procedure
The player chooses an ability relevant to the conflict at hand, describes exactly what his character is trying to accomplish, and how. The Narrator may modify these suggested actions to better fit the fictional circumstances, and describes the actions of the characters or forces on the other side of the conflict. 

The available resolution methods are as follows:

### Automatic Success
The PC simply succeeds. This may indicate that failure would not be interesting (such as finding an important clue, and the PC has an ability that it is credible could help to uncover that clue), or that failure would make the PC appear to be incompetent at a trivial or simple task for someone with that skill (such as a hunter bringing in the evening meal in a forest filled with game animals).

### Simple Contest
The player rolls a 20-sided die; the Narrator does the same. 

The Narrator compares the two results, and determines success or failure. Armed with this knowledge, she describes the outcome of the conflict, and any consequences to either participant.

If players enter into conflict with one another, each rolls dice, and the Narrator interprets the results, as usual.

### Extended Contest
A sequence of die rolls, between one or more PCs and one or more supporting characters, breaks the conflict resolution into a series of actions. This method trades speed for detail. 

## Choosing between Simple and Extended Contests
If in doubt, choose a simple contest.

An extended contest is appropriate where the PC has varied strategies to employ or the resistance takes various forms and instead of abstracting the conflict as one roll, we want to 'tell the story' of those moments. 

For example, consider a PC breaking into a house. This could be resolved with a simple contest and a roll against a Buglary ability for stealth or an Intimidate ability for the threat of violence. If the outcome is the important part of the story: did the the PCs get the MacGuffin or not, then a simple contest keeps the story flowing. Alternatively, if the house is occupied, and any failed Burglary roll will rouse the inhabitants, potentially leading to a confrontation, and the PCs choice to threaten or use violence if that happens is interesting to the story, use an extended contest.

Novice Questwords players may be tempted to use an extended contest to resolve all violent conflict with an extended contest, mirroring the detailed combat resolution of other games. Resist this if each exchange would simply be "I hit it with my axe," or "I shoot him with my gun" as the repition does not add to the story being told at the table and becomes dull.

All contest types can resolve the actions of multiple characters acting at once, on either side of the conflict.

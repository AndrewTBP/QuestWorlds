# Introduction

 Questworlds is a roleplaying rules engine suitable for play in any genre.  Its abstract resolution methods and scalable character levels make it equally suitable to any genre, from epic fantasy to satirical soap opera. 

## Why Questworlds?

Questworlds is meant to facilitate your creativity—and then to get out of your way. It is well suited to a collaborative, friendly group with a high degree of trust in each other’s creativity. If the members of your group are often at odds and rely on their chosen rules kit as an arbiter between competing visions of how the game ought to develop, Questworlds is not the rules set you need. Stick with your more structured system of choice.

### Players
Each player creates a character or PC. The PCs pursue various goals in an imaginary world. 

### Narrator
The Games Master (GM) or Narrator, portrays the imaginary world in which the PCs live. The Narrator controls other people and creatures, or non-player characters, in this fictional environment. 

### A Session
The players describe how their PCs pursue their goals; the Narrator challenges them by putting obstacles in their path. Sometimes these barriers to success come in the form of supporting characters who oppose them; at other times, they’re impersonal physical or mental challenges, like a lock that must be picked or a cliff the characters have to climb. Whenever the characters try to overcome a difficult obstacle, the Narrator decides how difficult it will be. Using numbers attached to their abilities, the players roll dice to see if they prevail. The Narrator rolls dice to represent the resistance posed by whatever challenge they face. Their success or failure, as determined by the die rolls, changes the direction of the story, in either a big or small way.

Although some games last for only an evening, it is typical for one group to play a series of stories involving the same characters and setting over a period of time. We refer to them collectively as a series, or sometimes a campaign.

# Abilities
Anything that your character can use to solve problems or overcome obstacles in a story can be an ability. You decide how to describe your abilities. Some abilities, such as your central area of expertise, can be very broad, entailing a wide variety of related capabilities. Others might be very colorful and specific, granting you advantages when you enter into a conflict with an opponent using a less directly applicable ability.

## Masteries
Questworld abilities are scored on a range of 1–20, but are scalable. When you raise a rating of 20 by one point, it increases not to 21, but to 1M. The M signifies a game abstraction called a mastery. You have now reached a new order of excellence in that ability.

As you progress, you may gain multiple masteries. Multiple mastery is marked with a number to the right of the M symbol. If you have 10M2, you have two masteries. 10M3 means that you have three masteries, and so on. 

# Hero Points
Each character starts the game with a pool of 3 hero points, and gains more of them at the end of every session. These are a precious resource, as they are used both to boost characters’ contest results, and to improve abilities over the long term. 

# Overcoming Obstacles
## Conflicts
Stories consist of a series of obstacles, which the heroes must overcome in order to reach their final goal.
A player’s encounter with a plot obstacle presents a conflict which must be resolved, either as a success or a failure. 

## Procedure
The player chooses an ability relevant to the conflict at hand, describes exactly what his character is trying to accomplish, and how. The Narrator may modify these suggested actions to better fit the fictional circumstances, and describes the actions of the characters or forces on the other side of the conflict. 

## Resolution Methods

The available resolution methods are as follows:

### Automatic Success
The PC simply succeeds. This may indicate that failure would not be interesting (such as finding an important clue, and the PC has an ability that it is credible could help to uncover that clue), or that failure would make the PC appear to be incompetent at a trivial or simple task for someone with that skill (such as a hunter bringing in the evening meal in a forest filled with game animals).

### Simple Contest
The player rolls a 20-sided die; the Narrator does the same. 

The Narrator compares the two results, and determines success or failure. Armed with this knowledge, she describes the outcome of the conflict, and any consequences to either participant.

If players enter into conflict with one another, each rolls dice, and the Narrator interprets the results, as usual.

### Extended Contest
A sequence of die rolls, between one or more PCs and one or more supporting characters, breaks the conflict resolution into a series of actions. This method trades speed for detail. 

All contest types can resolve the actions of multiple characters acting at once, on either side of the conflict.

## Framing the Contest
Contests in HeroQuest are more abstract than resolution methods in most other roleplaying games. They don’t simply tell you how well you succeeded at a particular task: they tell you whether or not you achieved your entire goal.

The player(s) taking part in the contest and the Narrator start by clearly agreeing on 1) what prize is up for grabs and 2) what tactics they’re using to try to get it. This process is called framing the contest.

Naming the prize: Narrators start framing the contest by asking the involved player(s) what prize they’re trying to win, or what goal they’re hoping to achieve.

• This may be a literal prize, like a gold cup, a gun, or a briefcase full of money.

• More often the prize is a metaphorical one, like access to a location—a treasure vault or the database servers containing the secret plans.

• In a struggle for resources, the winner gets control of something: a seat in government, a supply of goods, the assistance of an ally.

• In a fight, the prize may be the opponents themselves, who the PCs are  ghting to capture or kill. (Just as often they’ll be seeking another goal and must incapacitate enemy combatants to get it. In this case, beating the enemy is the tactic, not the prize.)

• The stakes may be defensive in nature, as when the PCs try to stop supporting characters from doing something harmful, like dropping a bomb on a city, or assassinating the king.

## No Repeat Attempts
A contest represents all of your attempts to overcome an obstacle. If you are defeated it means that no matter how many times you tried to solve the problem with your ability, you  nally had to give up. You can try again only if you apply a new ability to the task or the Narrator agrees that special circumstances exist.

## Default Ratings
If you enter a contest for which you have no relevant ability whatsoever, your base target number is a 6. Like ability ratings, it may be subject to modifiers.

## Die Rolls
To determine how well your character uses an ability, roll a 20-sided die (d20). Compare the rolled number with the target number to determine the level of success or failure. 

* Critical: If the die roll is 1 (even when the target number is 1), you succeed so brilliantly that the Narrator may reward your character with an extra, unexpected effect.
* Success: If the die roll is greater than 1 and less than or equal to the target number, you succeed, but there is nothing remarkable about the success.
* Failure: If the die roll is greater than the target number but not 20, you fail. Things do not happen as hoped.
* Fumble: If the die roll is 20, you fumble (even when the target number is 20). This is the worst result possible, and you will suffer a disturbing or entertaining catastrophe. The degree of success or failure of the PC and Narrator’s rolls are compared in either a simple or an extended contest.

At the same time, the Narrator rolls for the resistance.

## Victory or Defeat
A Critical is the best result, and a Fumble the worse result.

If the PC has a better result than the resistance the PC has a victory and they gain the prize set out when the contest was framed. If the PC has a worse result they are defeated and do not gain the prize.

If the PCs both have the same level success or failure, the better roll wins.

The narrator describes what happens, based on their interpretation of the results.

## Bumps
A bump affects the degree of success or failure of the die roll. A bump up improves the result by one step, changing a fumble to a failure, a failure to a success, or a success to a critical. Bump ups come from two sources: masteries and hero points (applied in that order). A bump down reduces the degree of success of your opponent. Bump downs come from one source: masteries.

### Bump Up with Mastery
If you’re engaged in a contest against a resistance, and you have an ability of 10M versus a resistance of 10, you enjoy an advantage. 

Opposed masteries cancel out, each contestant reducing their rating by the same number of masteries until only one or neither of them has masteries. A character with two masteries enjoys the same great advantage over one with a single mastery as a character with one mastery has over an opponent with no masteries. If you have an advantage of two or more masteries over an opponent, you can pretty much count on pounding him into the dust.

You get one bump up for each level of mastery your PC has greater than your opponent’s. 

## Bump Up with Hero Points
You can spend a hero point to bump up any result by one step. You may only bump your own rolls, not those of PCs or supporting characters—with the exception of sidekicks and retainers, which, as extensions of your characters, you may spend hero points on. You can decide to use a hero point for a bump after the die roll results are calculated (including any bump ups resulting from masteries

## Resistance
Most dramatic obstacles come in the form of supporting characters opposed to your goals. When you face impersonal or abstract forces, the Narrator chooses a Resistance to represent the difficulty of the obstacle.

Resistance numbers are derived from a base number, which is modified according to the resistance class, as per the following table:

RESISTANCE CLASS TABLE
| | |
| ------------- | ------------- |
|Class|Value|
|Nearly Impossible|Base +M2|
| Very High|Base +M|
|High|Base +6|
|Moderate|Base|
|Low|Base -6|
|Very Low|Base -M or 6, whichever is lower|
 
By default, the base starts at 14. After two sessions of play, it increases by 1. After every subsequent two-session interval, it increases by another point. Narrators may prefer other progression schemes that reflect the rate of advancement in their game, such as every four sessions of play, or every campaign.

All contests use the base number, except for contests to determine augments. Augmenting always faces a Moderate resistance—this is always the unmodified base value

## Better Roll
Questworlds supports two options for the 'better roll' the highest roll, or the lowest roll. Some groups prefer lowest roll, some higher. The preference toward 'low is better', is often because because 1 is a critical and 20 a fumble, and toward 'high is better' because the winner has rolled a higher number. Groups wanting higher abilities to win out slightly more often should use higher roll. Groups who use higher roll is better may also want to make 1 a Fumble and a critical rolling the Target Number exactly.

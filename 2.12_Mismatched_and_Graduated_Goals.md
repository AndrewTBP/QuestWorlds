## 2.12 Mismatched and Graduated Goals

Sometimes, the two sides in a **contest** may have goals that do not directly conflict one another. A huntsman pursues a nurse, who is trying to escape through the forest with two small children. The huntsman wants to kill the nurse. The nurse wants to save the children.

When encountering **mismatched goals**, your GM should determine whether the mismatch is complete, or partial.

In a **complete mismatch**, neither side is at all interested in preventing the otherâ€™s goal. A **complete mismatch** does not end in a **contest**; your GM asks what you are doing, and then describes each participant succeeding at their goals.

In most instances, the **contest** goals are not actually **mismatched**, but **graduated**. You have both a **primary** and a **secondary** goal. In this case, your GM frames the **contest**, identifying which goal is which. To achieve both, you must get a higher **result** than your opponent, such as **success** vs. **failure** or a **critical** vs **success**. On a better roll alone, such as **success** vs. **success** or **failure** vs **failure**, your GM may present you with the choice of which objective you obtain, where that choice illuminates your PC's priorities.

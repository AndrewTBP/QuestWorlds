# 2. Mechanics

In a QuestWorlds game, stories develop dynamically as you and your GM work together to role-play the dramatic conflict between your group's PCs using their **abilities** in pursuit of their goals and the obstacles, challenges, or threats that your GM presents to stand in your way.

Over the course of play, your GM will present various plot obstacles as conflicts to the PCs, resulting in either **victory** or ****defeat**** for your character. These conflicts can represent any sort of challenge you might face: fighting, a trial or debate, survival in a harsh environment, out-wooing rival suitors, and so on.

Rather than mechanically addressing the individual tasks that make up these conflicts, QuestWorlds usually assesses your overall **victory** or **defeat** in a single **contest** where you and your GM make an opposed roll pitting your characters **ability** vs the **resistance** the obstacle presents to you achieving your goal.

Whenever the GM presents an obstacle for you to overcome, you should "frame the contest" by describing what you are trying to accomplish, and which of your **abilities** (see below) you want to use to achieve that goal, and how. 

Based on that framing and other factors, your GM will asses what **resistance** the characters face. 

You roll a twenty-sided die (D20) against your PC's **ability**, and your GM rolls a D20 against the **resistance**. Your GM assesses your overall **victory** or **defeat** in the contest based on the **success** or **failure** of both rolls, and narrates the results of your attempt to overcome the obstacle accordingly. The direction of the story changes, in either a big or small way.

We encourage your GM to work with your suggestions when narrating the **victory** or **defeat**, but the final decision rests with them.

## 2.1 Abilities

Characters in QuestWorlds are defined by the **abilities** they use to face the challenges that arise in the course of their story. Rather than having a standard list of attributes, skills, powers, etc. for all characters, anything that you can apply to solve a problem or overcome an obstacle could be an one of your **abilities**. While your GM may provide some example **abilities** to chose from that connect your PC to a particular story or game world (whether created by your GM or by the designer of a particular game), you get to make-up and describe most or all of your **abilities**.

Some **abilities** might be broad descriptions of your background or expertise, like "Dwarf of the Chalk Hills" or "Private Detective" - implying a variety of related capabilities. Others might represent specific capabilities or assets such as "Lore of the Ancients," "Captain of the Fencing Team," or "The Jade Eye Medallion."

Ultimately, **abilities** are just names for the interesting things your character can do.

### 2.1.2 Ratings and Masteries

QuestWorlds **abilities** are **rated** on a range of 1–20, representing the **target number** you need to roll or less to succeed on your roll during a **contest** (see §2.3 for more details). **Ratings** are also scalable beyond that range using tiers of capability we refer to as **Mastery**. When you raise a **rating** of 20 by one point, either permanently through character advancement or a temporarily with **modifier** to a contest roll, the **rating** increases not to 21, but to 1M.

The "M" after the **rating** signifies **mastery**. You have now reached a new order of excellence in that **ability**, such that your die rolls will almost always succeed. Unless opposed by similarly exalted **resistance** (see §2.3.5.2 for more details) the number in front of the M is now the target number you seek to roll or less to achieve a **critical**!

As a **rating** climbs, you may even gain multiple **masteries** in it. **Mastery** tiers above one (representing an overall **rating** or 41 or more) are marked with a number to the right of the M symbol. Each successive **rating** increase over 20 becomes a new **mastery** tier. Thus, if you have 10M2, you have two **masteries** (representing a total **rating** of 50, 10+20+20). 10M3 means that you have three **masteries**, and so on.

Specific QuestWorlds games or genre packs may use other symbols relevant to their setting or genre to denote **mastery** instead of M. If so, this should be clearly noted by their designers.

In summary, to reflect abilities (or **resistance**s), higher than 20, you divide the **ability** by 20, noting a **mastery** for each multiple of 20 the **ability** exceeds, and treating the remainder as the **target number**. So, for an **ability** of 27, 27 ÷ 20 = 1 remainder 7, which translates into a **rating** of seven with one **mastery** written as "7M"; while for an **ability** of 43, 43 ÷ 20 = 2 remainder 3 , which translates into a **rating** of three with two **masteries**, written as "3M2" on the character sheet.

#### 2.1.2.1 No Relevant **ability** 

You may sometimes be faced with an obstacle for which you have no relevant **ability** whatsoever. In such cases, you may still enter into conflict with the obstacle using a minimum base **target number** of 6 for your **contest** roll. Like **ratings**, it may also be subject to **modifiers**.

#### 2.1.2.2 Making Ratings Quantitative

While QuestWorlds generally treats **ratings** as abstract measures of problem solving power rather than quantitive measures of in-fiction traits, some games may also depart from this practice in order to more closely couple key fictional elements to the mechanics. For example, a magic system might classify certain supernatural effects as Apprentice, Journeyman, or Master level, and require **ratings** of 15, 5M, or 1M2 (respectively) in a relevant **ability** to even attempt them. 

Such departures from abstraction should generally only be made where the increased complexity they bring leads to rewarding choices in a key area of interest to the setting or genre at hand. In most cases, you and your GM can simply follow the fiction surrounding your **ability** and its context within the setting for guidance as to what applications of the **ability** are credible.

### 2.1.3 Possessions and Equipment

Your character will generally be considered to have whatever equipment is reasonably implied by your abilities. Having an "Athenian Hoplite" **ability** will mean that your character posesses bronze armor, a shield, a spear, and a short-sword; while a "Country Doctor" would be expected to have a well-stocked medical-bag and possibly a horse & buggy in the right setting.

However, if you wish your character to possess something that is particularly special, interesting, or unusual, you may also enumerate a it as a rated **ability** in its own right, just like any other **ability** your character might use to solve a problem.  

In play, the degree to which you can overcome obstacles with your possessions depends not on any qualities inherent to the objects themselves, but to the **rating** of your relevant **ability**. However the significance of various sorts of gear lies in the types of actions you can credibly propose, and what their impact might reasonably be. An "Invisibility Cloak" ability implies very different fictional capabilities than "Souped-up Muscle Car" does.

Conversely, if in the course of play you find your character in a situation without equipment essential to utilize an ability effectively, or where your character's gear is poorly suited to the task at hand, your GM may take that account in assessing credibility-based **modifiers**.

### 2.1.4 Wealth

In QuestWorlds, wealth is treated as just another way to overcome obstacles. Many characters may not even have an explicit wealth **ability**, with their wealth or assets instead implied by **abilities** representing their background, profession, or status. Whether explicit or implied, the relevant **rating** is not an objective measure of the size of your fortune, but instead indicates how well you solve problems with money and resources. 

Similarly, treasures and other windfalls that arise during play may be represented in the rules via **plot augments** (see § 2.4.3) in **contests** where using the resource is relevant.

## 2.2 Hero Points

You start the game with a pool of three **hero points**, and gain three more of them at the beginning of every session. These are a precious resource, as they are used both to boost your **contest results**, and to improve your abilities over the long term. 

Any **hero points** not spent on boosting **contest results** or improving your character do not carry over to the next session.

## 2.3 Contest Procedure

You choose an ability relevant to the conflict at hand, describe exactly what you are trying to accomplish, and how. Your GM may modify these suggested actions to better fit the fictional circumstances, and describe the actions of the NPCs or forces on the other side of the conflict.

### 2.3.1 Resolution Methods

The Basic resolution methods are as follows:

#### 2.3.1.1 Automatic Victory

Sometimes, your GM may not call for a **contest** at all, in which case you are simply victorious in overcoming the obstacle at hand. This may be because **defeat** in the conflict to overcome the obstacle would lead to uninteresting results or a narrative dead-end, such as when finding an important clue is essential to the progress of an adventure. 

Your GM might also do this in cases where, within the fictional context, the particular ability you have brought to bear on the obstacle is such that overcoming the obstacle should be a trivial matter under normal circumstances (e.g. - a professional hunter bringing in the evening meal in a forest filled with game animals). In such cases, **defeat** would simply not be credible unless your GM wanted to introduce some further complications to the story. Generally, your GM will only use Automatic **victory** when you have a relevant ability to justify its application.

For cases where overall **victory** may be a given, but the degree, timeliness, or cost of that **victory** may be interesting concerns, consider the Advanced rules in §2.18.

#### 2.3.1.2 Simple Contest

The **simple contest** QuestWorlds's primary resolution mechanic for overcoming story obstacles, and is used the most often. It also provides the foundation for other types of **contests**, including several Advanced ones. As such, it receives both an overview of key concepts here as well as a more detailed treatment in §4.

At is most basic, a **simple contest** can be summarized as follows:

1. You and your GM agree upon the terms of the **contest**.
2. You roll a D20 vs your relevant ability, while your GM rolls a D20 vs the **contest**'s **resistance**.
3. Your GM compares the **success** or **failure** of the two rolls, and assesses your overall **victory** or **defeat**.
4. Your GM then narrates the **outcome** of the conflict as appropriate.

If you enter into conflict with another player rather than an obstacle presented by your GM, you both roll your relevant abilities for the **contest** instead of against a GM-set **resistance**, and your GM interprets the **results**, as described above.

### 2.3.2 Framing the Contest

#### 2.3.2.1 Contest Framing Overview

When a conflict arises during the game, you and your GM start by clearly agreeing on:

* What goal you are trying to achieve.
* What the obstacle is you are trying to overcome.
* What **tactic** you are using to and overcome it.

This process is called 'Framing the **contest**'.

#### 2.3.2.2 Conflict: Goals vs Obstacles

**Contests** in QuestWorlds don’t simply tell you how well you performed at a particular task: they tell you whether or not you overcame a story obstacle, which moves the story in a new direction. Unlike some other role-playing games, a **contest** in QuestWorlds does not resolve a task, it resolves the whole obstacle.

If you need secret records which are stored in a vault within a government compound, your goal is to get the information - while the fact that it is secured against your access is an obstacle you must overcome to attain that goal. Overcoming that obstacle may involve many possible tasks, evading guards, lock-picking, forging credentials, etc. - but the **contest** doesn't address those individually. The **contest** is framed around the entire conflict against the obstacle as a whole.

In a fight, your obstacle may be the opponents themselves, who you are fighting to capture or kill. Just as often you are seeking another goal and you might just as easily attain it by incapacitating or evading your foes. In this case, beating the enemy is a task, not the obstacle. For example, if an ally has been accused of treason by the King, your goal could be to prove the ally's innocence. The power of the King threatening your ally is an obstacle to be overcome, and a trial by combat could be a **contest** to resolve the conflict with an ability like "Knight Errant."

In a court trial, your goal is likely a particular verdict, while the obstacle might be the opposing lawyer, an unjust law, or even the justice system itself.  In this case, jury selection, a closing argument, revelatory evidence, or legal procedural challenges are tasks, not the entire obstacle. The overall conflict encompasses all those things.

A conflict to overcome an obstacle moves the story forward when it is resolved. If it is merely a step toward resolving an obstacle it is a task and not a conflict. While those component tasks may be interesting parts of narrating **tactics** and **results**, your GM should be sure to look for the story obstacle in conflict when framing a **contest**.

If there is no story obstacle to your actions, your GM should not call for a **contest** but simply let you narrate what you do, provided that seems credible.

For example, you are traveling from one star system to another. In the next star system you hope to confront the aged rebel who holds long-forgotten secrets that could bring freedom to the galaxy. Your GM feels there is no useful story obstacle for you to **contest** against, and so lets you describe heading down to the spaceport to secure a ship, meeting the captain and crew of your vessel, and traveling to the next world. Your GM encourages you to summarize what happens quickly so you can get to the meeting with the old rebel. Your GM knows that will be the real story obstacle, convincing the old rebel to part with his secrets.

#### 2.3.2.3 Tactics

You either choose an ability that represents any 'key moment' in overcoming that obstacle, or a broad ability that lets you overcome the whole obstacle. We call this choosing a **tactic**.

Your **tactic** might describe your using ability that helps you overcome a task within the obstacle:  sneaking past the guards, picking the locks, choosing the right jury or skewering your opponent with your foil. Or, your **tactics** might describe using a broad ability like "Ninja", "Lawyer", or "Fencer" to overcome all those challenges that might form part of the obstacle. Either way, if you succeed at that roll, you overcome the whole obstacle. Or by failing at that roll, you fail to overcome the obstacle, not just fail at one task.

When deciding on your **tactic**, focus on how your unique abilities would help you overcome the obstacle. This as the "key moment" where we focus on your PC. Use this moment to reveal your PC's strengths to the group. 

Your GM will determine if your **tactic** passes a **credibility test**. If you try to jump a 100 meters or run faster than a speeding car, your action is not credible and your GM will ask you to choose a different **tactic**.

Credibility depends on the genre, as what is not credible in a gritty police procedural might be in pulp where you might be able to leap from a bridge onto a speeding train. If in dispute, your GM should discuss with the group whether they consider your **tactic** credible for the genre.

**Extraordinary abilities** in some genres give you the ability to do the incredible. For example in a superhero genre you might fly or be invulnerable to bullets, in a fantasy genre hurl magical lightning bolts. A genre pack for the game should help define what incredible **tactics** are allowed for that game as part of an 'Extraordinary Powers Framework'.

The GM can narrate the remaining tasks that make sense of the story depending on your **success** with that roll, or have them occur 'off-stage' for speed. Think of the way TV or Cinema often cuts to the key moment of drama in a break-in, over showing us the whole heist from beginning to end.

#### 2.3.2.4 No Repeat Attempts

A **contest** represents all of your attempts to overcome an obstacle. If your lose it means that no matter how many times you tried to solve the problem, you finally had to give up. You can try again only if you use a new **tactic** to overcome the obstacle.

### 2.3.3 Resistance

Your GM chooses a **resistance** to represent the difficulty of the obstacle.

When setting **resistance**s it is important to understand that whilst traditional roleplaying games simulate an imaginary reality, QuestWorlds emulates the techniques of fictional storytelling.

Understanding this distinction will help you to play the game in a natural, seamless manner.

For example, let’s say that your GM is playing a game inspired by fast-paced, non-fantastic, martial arts movies in a contemporary setting. You are running along a bridge, pacing a hovercraft, piloted by the main bad guy. You wants your character, Joey Chun, to jump onto the hovercraft and punch the villain’s lights out.

In a traditional, simulative game, your GM would determine how hard this is based on the physical constraints you’ve already described. In doing so, they would come up with imaginary numbers and measurements. Your GM would have to work out how the distance between bridge and hovercraft. Depending on the rules set, they might take into account your relative speeds to the vehicle. Then they would use whatever resolution mechanic the rules provide them with to see if Joey succeeds or fails. If you blow it, your GM will probably consult the falling rules to see how badly you injure yourself (if you lands poorly), or the drowning rules, if you ends up in the river.

In QuestWorlds, your GM starts not with the physical details, but with the proposed action’s position in the storyline. They consider a range of narrative factors, from how entertaining it would be for you to succeed, how much **failure** would slow the pacing of the current sequence, and how long it has been since you last scored a thrilling **victory**. If, after this, they need further reference points, your GM can draw inspiration more from martial arts movies than the physics of real-life jumps from bridges onto moving hovercrafts. Having decided how difficult the task ought to be dramatically, your GM will then supply the physical details as color, to justify their choice and create suspension of disbelief, the illusion of authenticity that makes us accept fictional incidents as credible on their own terms. If they want Joey to have a high chance of **success**, your GM describes the distance between bridge and vehicle as impressive (so it feels exciting if you make it) but not insurmountable (so it seems believable if you make it).

In other words, in QuestWorlds your GM will pick a **resistance** based on dramatic needs and then justify it by adding details into the story.

**Resistance** numbers are derived from a base number, which is modified according to the **resistance** class, as per the following table:

### RESISTANCE CLASS TABLE

|Class|Value|
|:-------------:|:-------------:|
|Nearly Impossible|Base +M2|
|Very High|Base +M|
|High|Base +6|
|Moderate|Base|
|Low|Base -6|
|Very Low|Base -M or 6, whichever is lower|
 
By default, the base starts at 14.

All **contests** use the base number + **resistance** class, except for **contests** to determine **augments**.

**Augmenting** always faces a **moderate resistance**, this is always the unmodified base value.

### 2.3.4 Die Rolls

To determine how well you use an **ability**, roll a 20-sided die (d20). At the same time, your GM rolls for the **resistance**.

Compare your rolled number with the **TN** to determine the **result**, a level of **success** or **failure** for the roll (not the **contest** as a whole).

* **Critical**: If the die roll is 1 (even when the **TN** is 1), you succeed so brilliantly that your GM may reward them with an extra, unexpected effect.
* **Success**: If the die roll is greater than 1 and less than or equal to the **TN**, you succeed, but there is nothing remarkable about the success.
* **Failure**: If the die roll is greater than the **TN** but not 20, you fail. Things do not happen as hoped.
* **Fumble**: If the die roll is 20, you fumble (even when the **TN** is 20). This is the worst **result** possible, and you will suffer a disturbing or entertaining catastrophe.

### 2.3.5 Outcome

Your roll and that of your GM’s roll are compared to determine your overall **outcome** which will be either **victory** or **defeat** for the **contest** as a whole.

If you have a better **result** than the GM, then you have a **victory** and you gain the prize set out when the **contest** was framed.

If you have a worse **result**, then you are defeated and do not gain the prize.

If you both have the same **result**, the better roll wins.

if your rolls tie, then it is a standoff.

Your GM describes what happens, based on their interpretation of the **outcome**.

#### 2.3.5.1 Better Roll

QuestWorlds supports two options for the "better roll": the highest roll, or the lowest roll. Some groups prefer lowest roll, some higher. The preference toward "low is better", is often because because 1 is a **critical** and 20 a **fumble**, and toward "high is better" because the winner has rolled a higher number. Groups wanting higher abilities to win out slightly more often should use higher roll. 

We also use the phrase "worse roll" to indicate the losing roll.

#### 2.3.5.2 Confusing Ties

Your GM will describe most tied **outcomes** as inconclusive standoffs, in which neither of you gets what you wanted.

In some situations, ties become difficult to visualize. Chief among these are **contest**s with binary **outcomes**, where only two possible results are conceivable.

Your GM can either change the situation on such a tie, introducing a new element that likely renders the original prize irrelevant to both participants, or they can resolve the ties in your favor as a **marginal victory**.

#### 2.3.5.3 Bumps

A **bump** affects the degree of **success** or **failure** of your die roll. A **bump** up improves your **result** by one step, changing a **fumble** to a **failure**, a **failure** to a **success**, or a **success** to a **critical**. **Bump** ups come from two sources: **masteries** and **hero points** (applied in that order). A **bump** down reduces **result** by one step, changing a **critical** to a **success**, a **success** to a **failure**, or a **failure** to a **fumble**. **Bump** downs come from one source: **masteries**.

Bumps always affect **results** not **outcomes**, although the outcome could change as a result of gaining a different **result**.

#### 2.3.5.4 Bump Up with Mastery

If you’re engaged in a **contest** against a **resistance**, and you have an ability of 10M versus a **resistance** of 10, you enjoy an advantage. You get a **bump** to your die roll from that **mastery**.

You get one **bump** up for each level of **mastery** your PC has greater than your opponent’s. So against a **resistance** of 14 a PC's ability of 7M is treated as 7 vs. 14 but we **bump** the **result** one step in the the favor of the PC; a PC's ability of 3M2 is treated as 3 vs. 14 but we **bump** the **result** two steps in the the favor of the the PC.

This reflects the fact that an ability above 20 would always succeed on a D20. Because each **mastery** represents **automatic success** (apart from a **fumble**) on a D20, you roll against the remainder, and treat the **mastery** as a **bump**. So on an ability of 27 is 7M, which means a **target number** of 7 and **bump** the **result**; an ability of 43 means 3M2 or a **target number** of 3 and **bump** the **result** twice.

Opposed **masteries** cancel out, each contestant reducing their **rating** by the same number of **masteries** until only one or neither of them has **masteries**. If you have two **masteries**, then you enjoy the same great advantage over an opponent with a single **mastery** as a someone with one **mastery** has over an opponent with no **masteries**. If you have an advantage of two or more **masteries** over an opponent, you can pretty much count on pounding him into the dust.

This allows QuestWorlds to represent large differences in ability or **resistance**.

#### 2.3.5.5 Bump Up with Hero Points

You can spend a **hero point** to **bump** up any **result** by one step. You may only **bump** your own rolls, not those of other PCs or **supporting characters**—with the exception of **sidekicks** and **retainers**, which, as extensions of your character, you may spend **hero points** on. You can decide to use a **hero point** for a **bump** after the die roll **results** are calculated (including any **bump** ups from **masteries**).

You can only spend one **hero point** per roll.

## 2.4 Augments

You may sometimes face **contests** where more than one ability may be applicable to the conflict at hand. In such cases, you may attempt to use one ability to give a supporting bonus to the main ability you are using to frame the **contest**. This is called an **augment**. For example, if your character has the **abilities** "The Queen's Intelligencer" and "Master of Disguise", you might use the latter to **augment** the former when infiltrating a rival nation's capitol. Similarly, a character with "Knight Errant" and "My Word is my Bond" **abilities** might use one to **augment** the other when in conflict with an obstacle the character has sworn to overcome.

Abilities that represent special items, weapons, armor, or other noteworthy equipment can be a common source of **augments**. However, this grows tired if over-used and you should try and restrict repeated use equipment used in this way to **contests** where they are particularly interesting or apropos.

**Augments** can also come from other characters' **abilities** if one character uses an **ability** to support another's efforts rather than directly engaging in the **contest**. **Augments** can even come from outside resources like support from a community or other circumstantial help.

If you have a good idea for an **augment**, propose it to your GM while the **contest** is being framed. When making your proposal, describe how the **augmenting ability** supports the main one in a way that is both *entertaining* and *memorable*. Don't just hunt for mechanical advantage, show your group more about your PC when you **augment**, their attitudes, passions, or lesser known **abilities**. If you are **augmenting** with a **broad ability** like "Fool's Luck", be prepared to describe the unlikely events that tilt the scales in your favor. Your GM will decide whether the **augment** is justified and can refuse boring and uninspired attempts to **augment**, where you are just looking for a bonus to your roll and not adding to the story.

You may only use one of your own **abilities** to **augment** the **ability** you are using in the **contest**, and you may not use an **ability** to **augment** itself. However, **augments** from other players supporting you can add together with your own, along with other **modifiers**, including those from benefits of victory and from **plot augments**.

If you GM accepts your **augment** proposal, it will a be resolved by one of the methods below. The main **contest** then proceedes as normal, with any bonus from the **augment** added onto the **rating** of the **ability** chosen when framing the **contest**. The **augment** remains in effect for the duration of the **contest**.

### 2.4.1 Rolled Augments

To grant an **augment** to yourself, or another PC, in an upcoming **contest**, you engage in a **simple contest** against a **moderate resistance** before the main contest begins to determine whether the **augment** attempt results in and advantage. Frame this **augment contest** with your GM, making it clear how your supporting ability will achieve the goal of making your ability in the main **contest** more effective. **Augment contests** may not themselves be **augmented**, and if your **augment** attempt ends in **defeat**, you may not make another attempt at an **augment** for the main **contest**. 

If you are victorious in the **augment contest**, your GM will award a bonus of +3 to the **ability** used in the the main **contest**. If your description of how you were using the **augmenting** ability was particularly entertaining, your GM may increase the bonus to +6.

If you are using the advanced mechanic for **degrees of victory or defeat**, use the table below to interpret the **outcome** of the **simple contest**. Note that **penalties** for **defeat** when attempting an **augment** are much lessened compared to a regular **contest**.

### AUGMENT TABLE

|Contest Outcome|Modifier|
|:-------------:|:-------------:|
|Complete Victory|+M|
|Major Victory|+9|
|Minor Victory|+6|
|Marginal Victory|+3|
|Marginal Defeat|0|
|Minor Defeat|+0|
|Major Defeat|+0|
|Complete Defeat|-3|

### 2.4.2 Quick Augments

While an **augment contest** before the main **contest** can be dramatic and exciting, it does also slow down the flow of play. An alternative approach, called a **quick augment**, alleviates this by replacing rolling with a bonus equal to one-fifth of the **augmenting rating**. If your GM accepts your proposal for an **augment**, simply divide the **augmenting ability rating** by five, round down if necessary, and add the modifier as a bonus to your **ability** in the upcoming **contest**.

It is at your GM's discretion whether to roll **augments** or use **quick augments**. Your GM may choose one preferred approach and use it in every instance, or choose one or the other on a case-by-case basis based on interest and flow of play.  

### 2.4.3 Plot Augments

A plot **augment** occurs when your GM decides that your **victory** over a previous obstacle is sufficiently relevant to the **contest** at hand as to warrant a bonus much like a supporting **ability** can. The previous **contest** need not have been immediately prior to the current one, as long as its **outcome** remains relevant. The magnitude of a plot **augment** can be +3, +6, +9, or +M. The more challenging the previous **contest** was and the more relevant that **victory** is to the current challenge, the higher the **augment**.

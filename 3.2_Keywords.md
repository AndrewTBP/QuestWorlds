## 3.2 Keywords

You may build your PC around one or more **keywords**. A **keyword** gives you a package deal: you get a number of **abilities** by selecting a pre-existing character concept, which the player then modifies.

**Keywords** are best suited for use as the PC’s **occupation**. Often a keyword represents an occupation common the genre and has a narrative description of that occupation.

In certain genres, you may require multiple **keywords**: for example, one for **occupation**, another for species or culture, and perhaps a third for religious affiliation.

Here are two ways to handle **keywords**. If in doubt, choose Umbrella.

### 3.2.1 Keywords as Packages

Treat **keywords** simply as shorthand for a package of **abilities**. These can be increased together during character creation, but are too unrelated to increase together during a game. You are still free to use the **keyword** as an **ability**, and in fact may prefer to write only the specific **abilities** they’ve improved on their character sheet.

### 3.2.2 Keywords as an Umbrella

Treat **keywords** both as a raisable **ability**. To ensure that the potential uses of the keyword are credible the umbrella **keyword** usually has a text description, which mirrors the ability list from a package **keyword**. This approach keeps the character sheet from getting too cluttered. 

#### 3.2.2.1 Breakouts

If your character is particularly good at an aspect of an umbrella **keyword**, you create a **breakout ability** under the **keyword** at a **bonus** from the **rating** of the **keyword** you write these specialized **breakout abilities** under the **keyword**, along with how much they've improved from the **keyword**:

Detective 15

* Deduction +5
* Hard Drinking +5

In this example, whilst the **rating** for most **contests** in which Detective was an appropriate **tactic** would be 15, for contests involving Deduction it would be 20.

**Breakouts** may be similar to the list of **abilities** that a **package** would include. However, as these tend to be assumed in the umbrella **keyword** which is treated as an **ability** it is more interesting to have them *differentiate* your PC as an archetype from others. For example, if you want to portray the *stereotype* of the hard-drinking detective, you might add that as a **breakout** under the **keyword**. That **breakout** might also be flagged as a **flaw**.

### 3.2.3 Doubling Up

In some settings, an **ability** may be listed in more than one of a PC’s **keywords**. You should choose only one to list it under.

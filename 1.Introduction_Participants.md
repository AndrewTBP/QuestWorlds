# 1. Introduction

Questworlds is a roleplaying rules engine suitable for you to play in any genre.  It features an abstract, conflict-based, resolution method and scalable, customizable, character descriptions. Designed to emulate the way characters in fiction face and overcome challenges, it is suitable for a wide variety of generes and play styles. 

## 1.1 Why Questworlds?

Questworlds is meant to facilitate your creativity, and then to get out of your way. 

It is well suited to a collaborative, friendly group with a high degree of trust in each otherâ€™s creativity. Characters in Questworlds are described more in terms of their place in your imagination and the game setting than by game mechanics. 

If your group are often at odds and rely on their chosen rules kit as an arbiter between competing visions of how the game ought to develop, or use mechanical options to decide "what action to take," QuestWorlds is not a rules set that provides that structure. Make sure to discuss with your group whether you are collectively on board with trying a new play style dynamic, or if you would rather stick to more structured systems.

## 1.2 Version

The first version of these rules Hero Wars was published in 2000 (ISBN 978-1-929052-01-1)

The second version HeroQuest was published in 2003 (ISBN 978-1-929052-12-7). We refer to this as HeroQuest 1e to disambiguate.

The third version HeroQuest: Core Rules was published in 2009 (ISBN 978-0-977785-32-2). We refer to this as HeroQuest 2e.

HeroQuest Glorantha was published in 2015 (ISBN 978-1-943223-01-5). It is the version of the rules in HeroQuest 2e, presented for playing in Glorantha. We refer to this as HeroQuest 2.1e.

Questworlds was published as a System Reference Document (SRD) (this document) in 2018. The version of the rules here is slightly updated, mainly to clarify ambiguities, from the version presented in HeroQuest 2e and HeroQuest 2.1e. This makes this ruleset HeroQuest 2.2e, despite the name change. However, to simplify we identify this version as Questworlds 1e.

An Appendix lists changes in this version. As the SRD is updated we will continue to track version changes there.

## 1.3 Core & Optional Mechanics

We flag some mechanics as Optional. 

The Questworlds engine is intended to be rules-lite, so we distinguish between the core mechanics, and optional ones. 

A rule in an optional section can  be ommitted. Variation is possible, whilst retaining the feel of QuestWorlds. Optional rules provide more detailed or complex options. They add depth, but at the cost of speed of play.

Sub-headings under a heading should be considered part of the optional content.

If this is your first time reading these rules, you may wish to skip over these sections. Return to them once you understand the core mechanics.

If this is your first time playing these rules, you may wish to omit the optional rules at first, getting a feel for the game in its simplest form, and then add them in as you want more depth.

The optional mechanics can be added to play individually; they do not have to be all brought in together.

## Who Is This Document For? 
The primary audience for this document is game-designers who wish to use the QuestWorlds rules for their own game.

We recognize that some people will use this document to learn about the QuestWorls system, before purchasing it, and some players in games were the GM has a rule book, may use this to understand the rules.

For that latter reason, we address the rules here to a player.

Note that this document does not contain many examples, or much in the way of play advice and other non-rules text to help you play the game. This is a stripped down document and we assume that any game you buy based on these rules will include that, and use material relevant to their setting. For this reason, learning the rules from this document is not as easy as learning them from a game built on these rules.

## 1.4 Numbering

Sections within this document are numbered. This is for the benefit of game designers and reviewers. 

This does not imply that game designers need number the rules in their own games. 

Numbering however makes it easy to refer to rules in this document when page numbers may vary by presentation format for the purposes of error trapping or tracking changes. If you need to give us feedback about this document, that will assist us.

## 1.5  Participants

### 1.5.1 Players

Each player creates a Player Character (PC) to be their 'avatar' in the game. The PCs pursue various goals in an imaginary world. 

When we say 'you' in this document we may mean the player or their PC. Which should be clear from context, or explicity noted.

## 1.5.2 GM

The Games Master (GM), portrays the imaginary world in which the PCs live. The GM controls other people and creatures, or Non-Player Characters (NPCs), in this fictional environment. 

We generally refer to the GM as 'your GM'. If you are the GM in the game, the actions here apply to you.

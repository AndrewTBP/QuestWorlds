# 1. Introduction

Questworlds is a roleplaying rules engine suitable for play in any genre.  Its abstract resolution methods and scalable character levels make it equally suitable to any genre, from epic fantasy to satirical soap opera. 

## 1.1 Why Questworlds?

Questworlds is meant to facilitate your creativity—and then to get out of your way. It is well suited to a collaborative, friendly group with a high degree of trust in each other’s creativity. Characters in Questworlds are described more in terms of their place in the players' imaginations and the game setting than game mechanics. 

If the members of your group are often at odds and rely on their chosen rules kit as an arbiter between competing visions of how the game ought to develop, Questworlds is not the rules set you need. Stick with your more structured system of choice.

## 1.2 Version

The first version of these rules Hero Wars was published in 2000 (ISBN 978-1-929052-01-1)

The second version HeroQuest was published in 2003 (ISBN 978-1-929052-12-7). We refer to this as HeroQuest 1e to disambiguate.

The third version HeroQuest: Core Rules was published in 2009 (ISBN 978-0-977785-32-2). We refer to this as HeroQuest 2e.

HeroQuest Glorantha was published in 2015 (ISBN 978-1-943223-01-5). It is the version of the rules in HeroQuest 2e, presented for playing in Glorantha. We refer to this as HeroQuest 2.1e.

Questworlds was published as a System Reference Document (SRD) (this document) in 2018. The version of the rules here is slightly updated, mainly to clarify ambiguities, from the version presented in HeroQuest 2e and HeroQuest 2.1e. This makes this ruleset HeroQuest 2.2e, despite the name change. However, to simplify we identify this version as Questworlds 1e.

An Appendix lists changes in this version. As the SRD is updated we will continue to track version changes there.

## 1.3 Core & Optional Mechanics

We flag some mechanics as Optional. 

The Questworlds engine is intended to be rules-lite, so we distinguish between the core mechanics, and optional ones. 

A rule in an optional section can  be ommitted. Variations is possible, whilst retaining the feel of QuestWorlds. They provide more detailed or complex options. They add depth, but at the cost of speed of play.

Sub-headings under a heading should be considered part of the optional content.

If this is your first time reading these rules, you may wish to skip over these sections. Return to them once you understand the core mechanics.

Optional mechanics can be added to play individually; they do not have to be all brought in together.

## 1.4 Numbering

Sections within this document are numbered. This does not imply that implementers need number them. Numbering however makes it easy to refer to rules in this document when page numbers may vary by presentation format for the purposes of error trapping or tracking changes.

## 1.5  Participants

### 1.5.1 Players

Each player creates a player character (PC) to be their 'avatar' in the game. The PCs pursue various goals in an imaginary world. 

## 1.5.2 GM

The Games Master (GM), portrays the imaginary world in which the PCs live. The GM controls other people and creatures, or non-player characters (NPCs), in this fictional environment.

# 1. Introduction

Questworlds is a roleplaying rules engine suitable for you to play in any genre.  It features an abstract, conflict-based, resolution method and scalable, customizable, character descriptions. Designed to emulate the way characters in fiction face and overcome challenges, it is suitable for a wide variety of generes and play styles. 

## 1.1 Why Questworlds?

Questworlds is meant to facilitate your creativity, and then to get out of your way. 

It is well suited to a collaborative, friendly group with a high degree of trust in each otherâ€™s creativity. Characters in Questworlds are described more in terms of their place in your imagination and the game setting than by game mechanics. 

If your group are often at odds and rely on their chosen rules kit as an arbiter between competing visions of how the game ought to develop, or use mechanical options to decide "what action to take," QuestWorlds is not a rules set that provides that structure. Make sure to discuss with your group whether you are collectively on board with trying a new play style dynamic, or if you would rather stick to more structured systems.

## 1.2 Version

The first version of these rules Hero Wars was published in 2000 (ISBN 978-1-929052-01-1)

The second version HeroQuest was published in 2003 (ISBN 978-1-929052-12-7). We refer to this as HeroQuest 1e to disambiguate.

The third version HeroQuest: Core Rules was published in 2009 (ISBN 978-0-977785-32-2). We refer to this as HeroQuest 2e.

HeroQuest Glorantha was published in 2015 (ISBN 978-1-943223-01-5). It is the version of the rules in HeroQuest 2e, presented for playing in Glorantha. We refer to this as HeroQuest 2.1e.

Questworlds was published as a System Reference Document (SRD) (this document) in 2018. The version of the rules here is slightly updated, mainly to clarify ambiguities, from the version presented in HeroQuest 2e and HeroQuest 2.1e. This makes this ruleset HeroQuest 2.2e, despite the name change. However, to simplify we identify this version as Questworlds 1e.

An Appendix lists changes in this version. As the SRD is updated we will continue to track version changes there.

## 1.3 Core & Optional Mechanics

As the QuestWorlds engine is oriented towards rules-light play, we designate some mechanics as "Core" and others as "Optional." 

Core rules represent the minimum mechanical structure needed for a playable game with the feel of QuestWorlds, while optional rules add mechanical depth to areas of play which you or your GM might wish to emphasize, though possibly at a cost in speed of play.

In this document, we designate optional mechanics either by prefixing an entire section title as such, or by prefixing the title of an optional subsection within a core mechanic section. Subsections within an already optional-flagged parent section should be understood to be optional as well, even though their titles are not specifically prefixed.

The optional mechanics can be added to play individually; they do not have to be all brought in together. In cases where an optional mechanic depends upon or interrelates with another optional mechanic, that should be noted in the text.

If this is your first time reading these rules, you may wish to skip over these sections. Return to them once you understand the core mechanics. Similarly, if this is your first time playing these rules, you may wish to omit the optional rules at first, getting a feel for the game in its simplest form, and then add them in as you want more depth. Your GM may even decide to employ certain optional rules on a case by case basis, providing more detail or nuance to particularly interesting conflicts where beneficial, while otherwise taking a lighter approach.



## Who Is This Document For? 
The primary audience for this document is game-designers who wish to utilize the QuestWorlds rules framework to implement their own game.

We also recognize that some people will use this document to learn about the QuestWorlds system before purchasing it, and some players in games were the GM has a rule book, may use this as a reference to help understand the rules.

For that latter reason, we address the rules here to a player.

However, this remains a technical document with few examples, advice, or other non-rules text to help you play your game, as such are beyond the scope of this System Reference Document.

It is expected that the designers of games you play based on these rules will include such guidance and context as is relevant to their game's particular genre or setting, presented in a format better suited for learning how to play.

## 1.4 Numbering

Sections within this document are numbered. This is for the benefit of game designers and reviewers. 

This does not imply that game designers need number the rules in their own games. 

Numbering however makes it easy to refer to rules in this document when page numbers may vary by presentation format for the purposes of error trapping or tracking changes. If you need to give us feedback about this document, that will assist us.

## 1.5  Participants

### 1.5.1 Players

Each player creates a Player Character (PC) to be their 'avatar' in the game. The PCs pursue various goals in an imaginary world. 

When we say 'you' in this document we may mean the player or their PC. Which should be clear from context, or explicity noted.

## 1.5.2 GM

The Games Master (GM), portrays the imaginary world in which the PCs live. The GM controls other people and creatures, or Non-Player Characters (NPCs), in this fictional environment. 

We generally refer to the GM as 'your GM'. If you are the GM in the game, the actions here apply to you.

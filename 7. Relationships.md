# 7. Relationships
Abilities may represent the relationship of the PC to supporting characters.

## 7.1 Supporting Characters
Many relationships connect the PC to supporting characters controlled by the Game Master.

When the PC tries to use one of these relationships to solve a problem, they contest with their relationship ability. The PC can’t simply go to the supporting character they have a relationship with, stick them with the problem, and expect to see it solved.

If the PC succeeds, the supporting character helps them solve the problem. If they fail, they don’t. As with any ability, the player must still specify how the contact goes about overcoming the obstacle. Calls on relationships are almost always simple contests.

In crucial situations, it may seem dramatically inappropriate for a PC to solve a problem indirectly, by working through others. The Game Master can expose the supporting character to serious risk. If the character dies or otherwise suffers a change of status that renders him useless to the PC, the PC permanently loses the relationship ability. 

Before putting supporting characters at serious risk, Game Masters should make sure the players understand the magnitude of the possible consequences. 

When supporting characters undertake significant risk, the supporting character may suffer a consequence of defeat commensurate with the level of the defeat in the contest. Or
it may simply be the PC’s relationship with that is damaged or destroyed.

## 7.2 Allies
An ally is a character of roughly the same level of accomplishment as the PC, often in the same or a similar line of work. For every favor a PC asks of them, they’ll ask one of them. These reciprocal favors will be roughly equivalent in terms of risk, time commitment, difficulty, and inconvenience.

## 7.3 Patrons
Patrons enjoy greater access to resources than the PC, either through personal ownership (as in a Merchant Prince) or authority (as in the governnor of a province). They may lend the PC advice or provide them with resources but are too busy and important to personally perform tasks for them. They may hire the PC to do jobs, or issue orders within a command structure to which they both belong.  

When a PC rolls their Patron relationship, the Game Master adjusts the difficulty depending on what
the PC has done for them lately.

## 7.4 Contacts
A contact is a specialist in an occupation, skill, or area of expertise. Contacts provide information and perform minor favors, but will expect information or small favors from the PC in return.

You can describe a contact as being a particular individual, or as a group of similar individuals. 

### 7.4.1 Occupational Contacts
Any occupational keyword can be treated as a source of contacts. However, using an occupational keyword as a source of contacts will always be a stretch. To more reliably draw on particular contacts associated with a profession, a PC should take an explicit ability.

## 7.5 Followers
A follower is a secondary character that travels with the PC and contributes on a regular basis to their success.

There are two types of followers: sidekicks and retainers.

Followers need not be people, or even sentient beings: you can write up a spirit guardian, trusty robot, or companion animal as a follower.

### 7.5.1 Sidekick
A sidekick is a secondary character under the player's control. Most of the time they stays at the PC's side to render assistance, but they can also go off and perform errands or missions on their own. 

The PC should give their sidekick a name. They should, when asked, explain how the sidekick came to be
the PC's follower, and why they continues in that role.

Sidekicks start with three abilities, one rated at 17 and the others at 13. Any of these abilities may
be a keyword. At least one of them should indicate a personality trait.

If the sidekick is nonhuman or a member of an unusual culture, one of its three starting abilities
must be its species or culture keyword.

Once the PC has determined the sidekick’s base abilities, they allocate 15 additional points between three of them, spending no more than 10 on any one ability.

These abilities, like those of the PC, can be improved through the expenditure of Hero Points.

A player may use any of the sidekick’s abilities as they would their PC's. The companion can go off
and do things without the PC.

### 7.5.2 Replacing Lost Sidekicks
As a consequence of defeats in which they participated, sidekicks can be killed or leave the PC's
service permanently. 

Defeat in physical contests can lead to literal death. Metaphorical deaths from non-violent contests indicate a break with the PC. The sidekick may angrily withdraw from service, but is more likely to sorrowfully retire. A PC may be able to bring a sidekick back from metaphorical death by overcoming story obstacles.

If a player loses a sidekick, they may create a new one without needing to spend a Hero Point. They
must explain how the new sidekick has come to be their new follower.

PCs with retainers may find it convenient to promote them to sidekick status, giving them names and personalities, with a sudden boost in abilities and ratings to match.

### 7.5.3 Retainers
A retainer is a more or less anonymous servant or helper. The PC may specify a single retainer, or, where appropriate to the character concept, an entire staff of them.

Like any other ability, a retainer ability allows the player to overcome relevant obstacles by engaging in a contest. To model the contribution of retainers to the PC, where the PC is the primary actor, the player can use them to augment their ability. The GM can rule that consequences
of defeat apply to retainers.

Retainers generally regard the PC with all the affection and loyalty due to an employer or master. If the PC treats them more poorly than is expected for their culture, the GM should increase the difficulty level of attempts to make use of their talents.

If the PC loses retainers for any reason, they can replace them simply by providing a convincing
explanation of how you go about it. 

## 7.6 Relationships as Flaws
Certain relationships with supporting characters act as flaws. They impose obligations on the PC, prompting the GM to present the PC with obstacles they have no choice but to overcome.

### 7.6.1 Dependents
A dependent is a person, usually a family member or loved one, who requires the PCs aid and protection. The GM should periodically create storylines in which the dependent is endangered.

Rather than taking a dependent as a flaw, the player may find it more fruitful to specify the nature of the PC's relationship as an ability, such as Love for Wife or Love for Son.

### 7.6.2 Adversaries
An adversary is a rival, enemy or other individual who can be relied upon to periodically disrupt the PC's plans.

THe adversary’s goals are probably the opposite of the PC's, although he could be a bitter rival within the same community, organization, or movement.

To treat an adversary as an ability, rather than a flaw, describe the PC's emotional response to them. Examples: Hates Leonard Crisp, Fears the Electronaut, Sworn Vengeance Against Heimdall. That way, you still inspire the Narrator to add the plot elements you desire, but can use your antipathy toward the enemy to augment your target numbers against them.

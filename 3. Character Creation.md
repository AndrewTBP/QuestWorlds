# 3. Character Creation

## 3.1 As-You-Go Method

1. Concept
The concept is a brief phrase, often just a couple of words, that tells the GM and other players what the PC does and how they act. When in doubt, start with a noun or phrase indicating the PC’s profession or area of expertise, and modify it with an adjective suggesting a dominant personality trait:

* haughty priestess
* hotshot lawyer
* naïve warrior
* noble samurai
* remorseful assassin
* sardonic ex-mercenary 
* slothful vampire

2. Now provide the character with a name.
3. If the series uses other keywords, such as those for culture or religion, the PC may have them for free.
4. When events in the story put the PC in a situation where the player wants them to do something, the player makes up an applicable ability on the spot. The first time the PC uses an ability (including the two the PC starts play with), assign an ability rating to it. This may be a breakout ability from a keyword. The PC is restricted to only one Sidekick.
5. If the player wants, describe flaws.
6. Once the PC has 12 abilities (including the two for character concept), and up to three flaws the player is done creating their character.

## 3.2 Assigning Ability Ratings

A player has now defined a PC's abilities. These tell everyone what the PC can do. Now the player assigns numbers to each ability, called ratings, which determine how well they do these things.

The player assigns a starting rating of 17 to the ability they find most important or defining. Although most players consider it wisest to assign this rating to their area of expertise, which is also often a keyword, they don’t have to do this. All other abilities start at a rating of 13.

Now the player may spend up to 20 points to boost any of the PC's various ability ratings, including keywords. Each point spent increases a rating by 1 point. The player can’t spend more than 10 points on any one ability.

Some genre packs may require PCs to have additional keywords that reflect the setting. These additional keywords come from the 12 ability allowance, so in many genres the PCs will have fewer wildcard abilities but better fit the setting.

## 3.3 Keywords

A player may build a character around one or more keywords. A keyword gives the PC a package deal: the PC gets a number of abilities by selecting a pre-existing character concept, which the player then modifies. 

Keywords are best suited for use as the character’s core area of expertise. 

In certain genres, characters may require multiple keywords: for example, one for area of expertise, another for species or culture, and perhaps a third for religious af liation. 

Here are two ways to handle keywords. If in doubt, choose Umbrella.

**Keywords as Packages**: Treat keywords simply as shorthand for a package of abilities. These can be boosted together during character creation, but are too unrelated to increase together during a game. Players are still free to use the keyword as an ability, and in fact may prefer to write only the specific abilities they’ve improved on their character sheet.

**Keywords as an Umbrella**: Treat keywords both as raisable abilities and as a collection of more specific abilities. This approach keeps the character sheet from getting too cluttered but encourages specialization. Players write specialized abilities under the keyword, along with how much they've improved them:

In some settings, an ability may be listed in more than one of a character’s keywords. Choose only one to detail it under. 

## 3.3 Flaws

A player may assign up to three flaws to their PC. Common flaws include:

* Personality traits:surly, petty, compulsive.
* Physical challenges:blindness, lameness, diabetes.
* Social hurdles: outcast, ill-mannered, hated by United supporters.

Flaws are assigned a rating equivalent to the PC's abilities. The first flaw is rated at the highest ability, the second shares the same rating as the second-highest ability, and the third equals the lowest ability.
Certain keywords include flaws. Flaws gained through keywords do not count against the limit of three chosen  flaws. All flaws after the third are given the same rating as the third ability. A player may designate flaws from keywords as their first or second-ranked flaw. When flaws manifest during play, the GM places the PC in a contest against them, rolls their associated ability ratings as Resistances to the PC's efforts. This method applies to flaws that primarily present the character with additional obstacles to overcome.

GMs may decide during play that certain  aws are better expressed as penalties to the PC's attempts to overcome other resistances. Divide the value by 5 and round (a flaw of 19 imposes a –4 penalty). This is appropriate where the player specifies that your ability to solve problems drops under certain specific conditions. Examples might include:
* Tongue-tied in large gatherings. 
* Lousy with a stick shift.
* Can’t stand snakes.

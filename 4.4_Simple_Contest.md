## 4.4 Simple Contest

### 4.4.1 Advanced Procedure

1. Your GM **frames the contest**.
2. You choose a **tactic**, and figure your PC's **target number** (**TN**) using the **rating** of your **ability**, plus or minus **modifiers** the GM may give you. 
3. Your GM determines the **resistance**.  If two PCs contend, your opponent figures their **TN** as described in step 2.
4. Roll a d20 to determine your **degree of victory or defeat**, then apply any **bumps**. Your GM does the same for the **resistance**. Compare your rolled number with your **TN** to see how well you succeeded or failed with your **ability**. Remember to apply any **bumps** from **masteries** or **hero points**.
5. Determine **victory** or **defeat**

    *1. Determine **degree of victory**. Compare your **success or failure** with the GMâ€™s on the **simple contest table**.*
    
    *2. Determine **benefits of victory** or **consequences of defeat**.*

6. Describe the **outcome** based on the **story obstacle**.

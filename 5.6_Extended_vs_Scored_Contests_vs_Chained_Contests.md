## 5.6 Extended vs Scored Contests vs Chained Contests

We recommend that your GM chooses ONE form of **long contest** only, and stick to it, within a given campaign of *QuestWorlds*. If in doubt, use a **scored contest** by default. We also recommend that game designers choosing to use *QuestWorlds* as the basis of their own game, choose ONE form of **long contest** to include. This document is comprehensive to allow designers and GMs to choose.

**Scored contests** have the advantage of speed and simplicity. **Extended contests** have the advantage of each **exchange** allowing both parties to take turns acting, over your GM adjudicating who has the initiative; the bidding system also adds drama. **Chained contests** offer the benefit of grittier exchanges where the **outcomes** of each **round** have impact, as opposed to being 'cosmetic' until the end of the **contest**.

**Scored contests** require more interpretation by your GM, to determine who has the initiative and describe the nature of the next **round**. **Extended contests** drama comes at the cost of increased complexity, and some harder to interpret corner cases. **Chained contests** create a death spiral which can be hard to break out of.

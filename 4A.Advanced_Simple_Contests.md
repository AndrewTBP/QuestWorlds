## 4.3 Advanced Simple Contests

Advanced options for a simple contest allow greater granularity of the results, through benefits of victory and consequences of defeat.

## 4.4 Simple Contest

### 4.4.1 Advanced Procedure

1. Your GM frames the contest.
2. You choose a tactic, and figure your PC's target number (TN) using the ability rating and any modifiers. The PCs TN is the rating of their ability, plus or minus modifiers the GM may give you. 
3. Your GM determines the resistance.  If two PCs contend, your opponent figures their TN as described in step 2.
4. Roll a d20 to determine your degree of success or failure, then apply any bumps. Your GM does the same for the resistance. Compare your rolled number with your TN to see how well you succeeded or failed with your ability. Remember to apply any bumps from masteries or hero points.
5. Determine victory or defeat
    *1. Determine Degrees of Success. Compare your success or failure with the GMâ€™s on the Simple Contest Results table.*
    *2. ODetermine Benefits of Victory or Consequences of Defeat.*
6. Describe the result based on the story obstacle.

### SIMPLE CONTEST RESULTS TABLE

|Roll|Critical|Success|Failure|Fumble|
|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|
|Critical|High roll = Marginal Victory, else tie|Minor Victory|Major Victory|Complete Victory|
|Success|Minor Victory|High roll = Marginal Victory, else tie|Minor Victory|Major Victory|
|Failure|Major Victory|Minor Victory|High roll = Marginal Victory, else tie|Minor Victory|
|Fumble|Complete Victory|Major Victory|Minor Victory|Tie*|

* In a Group Simple Contest (see below), your GM may declare that both contestants suffer a Marginal Defeat to indicate that, although their results cancel out with respect to each other, their situation worsens compared to other contestants.

## 4.5 Advanced Group Simple Contest

### 4.5.1 Procedure

1. Your GM frames the contest.
2. You choose a tactic, and figure your PC's target number (TN) using the ability rating and any modifiers. Your TN is the rating of their ability, plus or minus modifiers the GM may give you. 
3. Your GM determines the resistance.  If two PCs contend, your opponent figures their TN as described in step 2.
4. For each of your group, roll a d20 to determine your degree of success or failure, then apply any bumps. Your GM does the same for the resistance. Compare your rolled number with your TN to see how well you succeeded or failed with your ability. Remember to apply any bumps from masteries or hero points.
5. Determine the number of OPs scored by the victor in the contest from the Group Simple Contest Results table. On a tie the victory goes to the Better Roll.
6. Sum the OPs gained for each side.
6. The side with the highest number of OPs is the victor in the contest.
    *1. Determine Degree of Success based on the difference between the winner and loser's outcome point totals on the Group Simple Contest results table.*
    *2. Determine Benefits of Victory or Consequences of Defeat.*
7. Describe the result based on the agreed prize.

|Difference Between Results|Winning Group's Degree of Success|
|:-------------:|:-------------:|
|1|Marginal|
|2|Minor|
|3-4|Major|
|5+|Complete|

### 4.5.2 Consequences and Benefits

Depending on which approach seems to grow from the story, your GM may assign Consequences of Defeat or Benefits of Victory from Group Simple Contests to the entire group, or to individual members who performed either especially well, or especially poorly. Your GM should default to rewarding or penalizing everyone. Your GM should resort to individualized repercussions or benefits only when a group reward defies dramatic credibility, or when competition within the group is a pivotal dramatic issue.

### 4.5.3 Boosting Results

Because they average together the results of multiple participants, group simple contests tend to flatten outcomes, making victories more likely to be marginal or minor than major or complete.

To overcome this flattening effect, you can, at the beginning of a group simple contest, spend one or more Hero Points to purchase a boost. A boost assures a clearer victory, should you prevail.

The cost varies by the number of heroes participating: 

* 1 Hero Point for 1-3 heroes.
* 2 Hero Points for 4-6 heroes.
* 3 Hero Points for 7-9 heroes.  
* and so on...

You may spend twice as many Hero Points as required to gain a double boost. The points may be spent by any combination of players. They remain spent no matter how the contest resolves.

On a tie or a victory, the boost increases the collective victory level by one step. A double boost increases it by two steps.

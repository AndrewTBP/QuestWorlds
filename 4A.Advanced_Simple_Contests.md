## 4.3 Advanced Simple Contests

Advanced options for a simple contest allow greater granularity of the **outcome**, through **benefits of victory and consequences of defeat**.

## 4.4 Simple Contest

### 4.4.1 Advanced Procedure

1. Your GM **frames the contest**.
2. You choose a **tactic**, and figure your PC's **target number** (**TN**) using the **rating** of your **ability**, plus or minus **modifiers** the GM may give you. 
3. Your GM determines the **resistance**.  If two PCs contend, your opponent figures their **TN** as described in step 2.
4. Roll a d20 to determine your **degree of victory or defeat**, then apply any bumps. Your GM does the same for the **resistance**. Compare your rolled number with your **TN** to see how well you succeeded or failed with your **ability**. Remember to apply any bumps from **masteries** or **hero points**.
5. Determine victory or defeat

    *1. Determine **degree of victory**. Compare your **success or failure** with the GMâ€™s on the **simple contest table**.*
    
    *2. Determine **benefits of victory** or **consequences of defeat**.*

6. Describe the **outcome** based on the **story obstacle**.

### 4.4.2 Degree of Victory

### SIMPLE CONTEST TABLE

|Roll|Critical|Success|Failure|Fumble|
|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|
|Critical|Better roll = Marginal Victory, else tie|Minor Victory|Major Victory|Complete Victory|
|Success|Minor Victory|Better roll = Marginal Victory, else tie|Minor Victory|Major Victory|
|Failure|Major Victory|Minor Victory|Better roll = Marginal Victory, else tie|Minor Victory|
|Fumble|Complete Victory|Major Victory|Minor Victory|Tie*|

* In a **group simple contest** (see below), your GM may declare that both contestants suffer a ***marginal defeat** to indicate that, although their **results** cancel out with respect to each other, their situation worsens compared to other contestants.

## 4.5 Advanced Group Simple Contest

### 4.5.1 Procedure

1. Your GM **frames the contest**.
2. You choose a **tactic**, and figure your PC's **target number** (**TN**) using the **rating** of your **ability**, plus or minus **modifiers** the GM may give you. 
3. Your GM determines the **resistance**.  If two PCs contend, your opponent figures their **TN** as described in step 2.
4. For each of your group, roll a d20 to determine your **degree of victory or defeat**, then apply any bumps. Your GM does the same for the **resistance**. Compare your rolled number with your **TN** to see how well you succeeded or failed with your **ability**. Remember to apply any bumps from **masteries** or **hero points**.
5. Determine the number of OPs scored by the victor in the **contest** from the **group simple contest table**. On a tie the victory goes to the Better Roll.
6. Sum the OPs gained for each side.
7. The side with the highest number of OPs is the victor in the **contest**.

    *1. Determine **degree of victory** based on the difference between the winner and loser's **outcome point** totals on the **group simple contest table**.*
    
    *2. Determine **benefits of victory** or **consequences of defeat**.*

8. Describe the **outcome** based on the agreed **prize**.

### DEGREE OF VICTORY TABLE

|Difference Between OPs|Winning Group's Degree of Victory|
|:-------------:|:-------------:|
|1|Marginal|
|2|Minor|
|3-4|Major|
|5+|Complete|

### 4.5.2 Consequences and Benefits

Depending on which approach seems to grow from the story, your GM may assign **consequences of defeat** or **benefits of victory** from Group Simple Contests to the entire group, or to individual members who performed either especially well, or especially poorly. Your GM should default to rewarding or penalizing everyone. Your GM should resort to individualized repercussions or benefits only when a group reward defies dramatic credibility, or when competition within the group is a pivotal dramatic issue.

### 4.5.3 Boosting Outcomes

Because they average together the **outcomes** of multiple participants, **group simple contests** tend to flatten **outcomes**, making **victories** more likely to be **marginal** or **minor** than **major** or **complete**.

To overcome this flattening effect, you can, at the beginning of a **group simple contest**, spend one or more **hero points** to purchase a **boost**. A **boost** assures a clearer **victory**, should you prevail.

The cost varies by the number of heroes participating:

* 1 **hero point** for 1-3 heroes.
* 2 **hero points** for 4-6 heroes.
* 3 **hero points** for 7-9 heroes.  
* and so on...

You may spend twice as many **hero points** as required to gain a **double boost**. The points may be spent by any combination of players. They remain spent no matter how the **contest** resolves.

On a tie or a victory, the **boost** increases the collective victory level by one step. A **double boost** increases it by two steps.

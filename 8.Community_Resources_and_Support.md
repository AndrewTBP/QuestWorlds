# 8. (Advanced)s Community Resources and Support

Some series revolve around the relationship between a band of influential figures and the community they protect. In defense of the community, they can bolster, expend, and juggle its various resources.

These advanced rules allow your GM to track the rise and fall of the fortunes of your community, and your impact on them.

If your GM intend to play a game centered around a community, you should have a relationship to that community. It is possible that you have relationships with other communities, that are not the focus of play. Treat these relationships as abilities that you can call on, but your GM should not track these  communities with these rules. Your GM should pick the level of community that provides the greatest dramatic potential from its competition for resources, friendly or otherwise, with its rivals.

Some campaigns do not center on a community, with the adventurers being footloose wanderers. In that case, even if you have community abilities, your GM will not track any community. Before you decide this though, consider where your PCs might turn for help, succor, or aid. Is there somewhere in the campaign defined as a place of refuge and safety for you. It may well be that there is a community, the bar where other footloose adventurers all meet, who will help each other out in a tight spot for example, that your GM can model.

## 8.1 Community Design

### 8.1.1 Defining Resources

Communities can have any set of abilities your GM defines. Your GM should Focus on no more than five or so broadly-labeled resource types, so that the PCs can care about (and have a chance of successfully managing) all of them. 

Most communities have variants of the following resources, perhaps with more colorful names:

* Wealth — measures the community’s material resources, whether counted primarily in dollars, credits, or cattle
* Diplomacy — the **ability** to extract favors from other communities, while minimizing the cost of its reciprocal obligations
* Morale — the community’s belief in its **ability** to achieve its goals, and willingness to follow the directives of its leaders
The following abilities might appear, depending on setting:
* Military — its **ability** to defend itself from outside threats, and to aggressively achieve its own aims through force of arms (for settings where communities of the size you’re tracking  eld their own armed units)
* Magic — the collective **ability** of its people to perform supernatural acts (for fantasy worlds)
* Technology — its access to specialized, rare or secret devices or scientific knowledge not shared by its rivals (for post- apocalyptic or SF worlds)

Similar communities in the genre, should have the same set of resources.

### 8.1.2 Specify an interval.

Your GM chooses a suitable interval to mark changes in resources. For genres bound by the agricultural season, this is usually a season, for a military genre it might be a campaign, for a ship a voyage.

### 8.1.3 Assigning Ability Ratings

Your GM distributes the following **ratings** between the five abilities: 12W, 9W, 18, 18, and 12. Note that the size of the group doesn’t affect the **ratings**.

Your GM may create a questionnaire that asks the players to make choices about the history of their community. They can choose their multiple-choice answers by consensus, majority vote, or take turns. Each question secretly assigns a score to one or more resource types. When you’re done, rank the resources in the order of the scores, assigning the high **ratings** to the highest questionnaire results and the lowest to the low.

A questionnaire introduces your setting in a punchy, interactive format, and tailors the community to the players’ desires, increasing their investment in it.

### 8.1.4 Resource Notation

Your GM will keep track of **modifiers** to community resources with a copy of the following record sheet. They will use a pencil, because the numbers will fluctuate.

Your GM lists the names and **ratings** of your chosen resources in the first row. Under the total column for each, your GM will list the total current modifier. Under the PC column, your GM lists **bonuses** resulting from PC activities (as opposed to un-cemented background events.) When PCs cement a background benefit, your GM adds its bonus to the PC column.

When PC activity reduces a **penalty** but does not eliminate it, your GM will alter the entry under the Total column to reflect the reduction, but leave the PC column blank.

### RESOURCE NOTATION TABLE

|Total|PC|Total|PC|Total|PC|Total|PC|Total|PC|
| ------|------- | ------|------- | ------|------- | ------|------- | ------|------- |
| | | | | | | | | | |

## 8.2 Drawing on Resources

You can use community resources as your own after convincing the community to let you expend precious assets. This requires a preliminary **contest** using a social **ability**, most likely your community relationship. Your GM will use a **moderate resistance** as the baseline, with higher **resistance**s when your proposals seem selfish or likely to fail, and lower ones when everyone but the dullest dolt would readily see their collective benefits. your GM may increase **resistance**s if your group draws constantly on community resources without replenishing them.

The lobbying effort and the actual resource use require framing, a clear description of what you are doing, and other details to bring them to fictional life. You can use resources directly, or to **augment** their own abilities.

Unlike character abilities, each use of community resources temporarily depletes it.

On a victory, you win the prize specified by **contest framing**, and a **penalty** is applied to subsequent uses of the resource.

On a defeat, you lose the prize and an even more severe **penalty** is applied to subsequent resource uses. If you fail to secure the prize you were seeking, the depletion **penalty** is also applied to your social and community abilities when interacting with members of your community. This reflects community displeasure at your fruitless expenditure.

**Penalties** from the Resource Depletion Table replace standard **penalties** for defeat, not add to them.

Like other **modifiers** to resources, depletion **penalties** end at the end of the current interval. These include depletion **penalties** applied to character abilities. However, a depletion **penalty** left unattended at the end of the interval can result in a permanent drop in the relevant resource.

If your GM wants resource depletion to lead to longer-lasting social **penalties** can, at the cost of some extra bookkeeping, they can have the characters shed a 3-point **penalty** at the end of each interval.

### RESOURCE DEPLETION TABLE

|Contest Outcome|Depletion Penalty|
|:---------------:|:-----------------:|
|Complete Victory|0|
|Major Victory|-3|
|Minor Victory|-3|
|Marginal Victory|-3|
|Marginal Defeat|-6|
|Minor Defeat|-6|
|Major Defeat|-6|
|Complete Defeat|-9|
  
### 8.2.1 Required Resource Use

As part of your GM's setting design, they may specify that certain actions in a setting always require the use of a community resource. Because the resource use is obligatory, it need not meet the usual criteria for entertainment value. Also, when the resource is used as an **augment**, you can also add a second **augment** from some other **ability**, adjudicated according to the standard rules, including entertainment value criteria. (This way, the required resource use doesn’t penalize you by forcing you to **augment** with a low-rated resource when you could otherwise use a higher-rated **ability**.)

### 8.2.2 Penalties to Resources

Threats to community resources act as a spur to PC action. Your GM may rule that the **penalty** from any **outcome** may be applied to a resource. (It might at the same time be applied to one or more PC abilities.)

When choosing a **penalty** arising from a player defeat in a **simple contest**, your GM will use the **consequences Of defeat** table. For a **long contest**, the **penalty** corresponds to the second worst **state of adversity** suffered by a defeated group member.

If your group voluntarily concede a **contest** by withdrawing, your community suffers resource depletion equivalent to a Major Defeat.

### 8.2.3 Bolstering Resources

You can add **bonuses** to community resources by seeking out and overcoming relevant obstacles, specifying in the **contest** framing that the proceeds of victory go the community. If you succeed, **bonuses** from the **benefits of victory** table are applied to a resource instead of one or more character abilities. (Your GM may rule that the bonus also applies to you in social situations that involve community members, reflecting gratitude for their efforts on behalf of the community.)

### 8.2.4 Background Events

Your changes to resources take center stage in a series, but in the background all sorts of other events periodically alter the community’s prosperity. These include the actions of other community members, who are depleting and replenishing resources all the time, as well as the unexpected intrusion of outside forces.

At the beginning of each interval, one of the your group should perform a simple **contest** of each resource against a **resistance** equal to the average value of all resources. These **contest**s simulate events outside of your control or influence; they can’t be **augmented** or **bumped** up with **hero points**.

The **outcome** of the contest may apply a modifier to a resource, as per the following table:

### RESOURCE FLUCTUATION TABLE

|Outcome|Depletion Penalty|
|:---------------:|:-----------------:|
|Complete Victory|+9|
|Major Victory|+6|
|Minor Victory|+3|
|Marginal Victory|0|
|Marginal Defeat|0|
|Minor Defeat|-3|
|Major Defeat|-6|
|Complete Defeat|-9|  

Except where your group is exceptionally keen on tracking resources, your GM should skip the background events process when the PCs are long absent from home. YOur GM should rejigger them to serve their plot purposes when they return. The GM may also want to shuffle this process offstage when the PCs are occupied by epic events. This prevents them from having to flee from a climactic plot development to go home and tend to the beet crop.

### 8.2.5 Crisis Tests

When resources endure **penalties**, you conduct a crisis test at the beginning of each game session to see if trouble strikes the community. A high but penalized **rating** can still lead to crisis, because people have adjusted to the equilibrium it offers and feel squeezed when it shifts on them.

A crisis test is a simple **contest** (one for each penalized **ability**) of the Resource **rating** against a **resistance** equal to the average of all resource **ratings**. Like background event checks, these can’t be **augmented** or **bumped** up by player action. On any defeat, the community starts to visibly suffer.

Your GM invents the specific reasons for each fluctuation and narrates them to you.

Resource crises should spur you to action, challenging you to find ways to bolster the affected resources (see above). When bolstered, the crisis is reversed. If you neglect your duties or fail, the crisis worsens.

Your GM will call for crisis tests only as needed, as a tool to generate story elements. If your group already has enough story on its hands, your GM will suspend them until you next need a new plot hook.

### 8.2.6 Cementing Benefits of Background Events

**Bonuses** from background events are temporary, unless you take steps to lock in your benefits. Doing so requires you to achieve a major goal, perhaps taking focus for an evening’s worth of play. If you succeed, the background event bonus may, as per the next section, later solidify into a permanent increase in the resource’s **rating**.

When you cement a background bonus, your GM changes their notation of that bonus.

## 8.3 Changes to Resource Ratings

At the end of your GM's chosen interval, they review the resource notation table.

Any resource with a bonus of 3 or more in its PC column increases by 1 for each 3 points of bonus, for a maximum increase of 3.

Any resource with a **penalty** in its Total column decreases by 1 for each 3 points of **penalty**, for a maximum loss of 2.

Any remaining **modifiers** are now reduced to 0.

The GM now start a new Resource Notation table, with resource ratings altered to reflect any changes from the above process.

Having made permanent changes to the community’s resource **ratings**, your GM then restarts the cycle by again testing for a new set of background events.

## 8.4 Changes from Plot Events

Your GM may decide that certain remarkable triumphs or horrifying catastrophes may directly alter a resource **rating**, independent of the resource tracking system given here. The possibility of a dramatic swing in community fortunes should be made clear by your GM during **contest** framing, so that you know the stakes and can pull out all the stops to secure victory or stave off defeat.

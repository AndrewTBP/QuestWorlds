## 5.3 Extended Contest

**Extended contests** are longer and more dramatic than **simple contests**. Your GM uses **extended contests** when the **outcome** of the struggle is important, to generate suspense for the players, or when they want a back-and-forth struggle. It is something you and your GM should visualize and describe.

An **extended contest** consists of one or more **rounds**, in which you perform actions that are similar to **simple contests**. However, actions and **rounds** do not decide the **outcome** of the whole **contest**, only who gains or loses **advantage points (AP)** at that time. You take actions in turn, an **exchange**, losing and gaining the advantage, until either you or your opponent runs out of **advantage points** and is **defeated**.

### 5.3.1 Procedure

1. Your GM **frames the contest**.
2. You choose a **tactic**, and figure your PC's **target number** (**TN**) using the **score** of your **ability**, plus or minus **modifiers** the GM may give you. Figure your starting **advantage point (AP)** total (see §5.3.2.1).
3. The GM determines the **resistance**. The GM opposes the PC with a **resistance**—the harder the task or tougher the opponent, the higher the **resistance**. The GM figures starting **APs** for the **resistance** (see §5.3.2.1).
4. Carry out one or more **rounds**, repeating as necessary.
    1. Each **round** consists of two **exchanges**: an action and immediate response.
        1. You describe your action towards the desired **prize** and bid **APs** *(see §5.3.2.2).
        2. The GM then hazards a number of **APs** bid by the **resistance**.
        3. Then starting with the highest bid, conduct the pair of **exchanges**.
            1. Conduct a **simple contest** as normal, but once the **outcome** has been determined, it becomes a number of **advantage points** scored by the winning side.
            2. The number of **advantage points** the winner garners at the end of each **round** depends on the difference in their **results**, (see below).
            3. If either contestant reaches 0 **advantage points** or fewer, the contest is over.
5. Award **experience points** if appropriate (see §8.1).

### 5.3.2 Advantage Points

#### 5.3.2.1 Starting AP Totals

You describe your action towards the desired **prize** and what **ability** you use. The **ability** used in the contest can be varied, but **APs** are always calculated on the first **ability** that you use in a contest. That **ability** must be used in the first **round**. Figure your starting **advantage point (AP)** total using the **TN**, including all **modifiers** and **augments**. The **AP** include +20 for each level of **mastery**, and can also be increased by **followers**.

The GM figures starting **APs** for the **resistance** from the **resistance** **TN**.

#### 5.3.2.2  Bidding Advantage Points

You gamble a number of your **APs** in an attempt to reduce your opponent’s **AP**, but if you fail the attempt you lose the **AP**.

You describe your action towards the desired **prize**, what **ability** you use, and how much risk you take. “I want to climb straight up to that outcrop, taking chances if needed.” You can specify your **AP bid**; if you do not, your GM determines this based on the amount of risk you are taking.

The size of the **bid** mirrors how bold and risky your character’s action is. Extreme or aggressive actions mean a high **AP bid**, and cautious actions require less. If you describe an all-out offensive with your sword cutting vicious arcs, you need to bid a lot of **APs**; if you say that you are circling your foe cautiously, a low **bid** is in order. Your GM  will look at the level of risk you are taking, and may suggest that you change your **bid** to better match your actions. If you do not declare a **bid** before rolling the die, your GM will decide how many points are **bid** (using 3 as a default), with riskier actions calling for higher **AP bids**.

#### 5.3.2.3 Losing Advantage Points

The number of advantage points lost by a contestant is a multiplier of their bid depending on the rank of the **victory**. Determine the multiplier used as follows:

#### 5.3.2.4 EXTENDED CONTEST EXCHANGE TABLE

|Rank    |AP loss by loser|
|:------:|:------------:|
|Tie|Both lose 1/2 bid, round up|
|0|½ x bid, round up|
|1|1 x bid|
|2|2 x bid|
|3|3 x bid|
|4|4 x bid|
|*n*|*n* x bid|

* If the victor rolled a **big success**, the **APs** lost by the loser are gained by the winner - a transfer.

#### 5.3.2.5  Followers and Advantage Points

**Followers** can act in different ways during a **contest**, **augmenting** you with their **abilities** or allowing you to use one of your **abilities** as if it were your own. Alternatively, a **follower** with a relevant **ability** or **keyword** can simply add their **APs** to the PC’s at the beginning of the **contest**.

Remember to figure any **modifiers** into your **follower’s** **ability** before adding it to your starting **AP** total.

Neither you nor the GM makes rolls for **followers**. Instead, their actions are subsumed into yours. The **follower’s** relevant **ability** or **keyword** is used solely as a source of **advantage points**.

You can assign your **followers** to someone else, although you may have to succeed at a contest to persuade a reluctant follower to go along.

#### 5.3.2.6 Advantage Point Knowledge

Once your opponent has won or lost **APs** during the current contest, you can ask the GM what the opposition's **AP** total is. This is where the element of skill comes in. When choosing how many **APs** to stake, you must weigh the effect they want to gain if you succeed versus the risk you face if the action fails.

#### 5.3.2.7 Advantage Point Recalculation

**Advantage points** are only relevant for the length of a particular **contest**. Your PC does not have any until the next **extended contest** begins, when you calculate them all over again.

### 5.3.3 Extended Contest Outcomes

Your GM uses the final **AP** total of the loser to determine the **rank** of the **victory** or **defeat** for the PC.

#### 10.3.6.1 EXTENDED CONTEST TABLE

|Final AP Total  |Rank|
|:--------------:|:-------------:|
|0 to –10 AP     |0              |
|–11 to –20 AP   |1              |
|–21 to –30 AP   |2              |
|–31 or -40 AP   |3              |
|–41 or fewer AP |4              |

Your GM may apply **consequences** and **benefits**  for your PC as they see fit, based on this outcome. 

### 5.3.4 Parting Shot

When you **defeat** an opponent in an **extended contest**, you can act again immediately to try to make their **consequences** more severe. This is called a **parting shot**. 

In the **round** immediately after you take an opponent out of the **contest**, you may attempt to gain another **prize** from your opponent suffers by engaging in a **parting shot**. This is an attempt (metaphoric or otherwise) to kick your opponent while he’s down:

* Striking an incapacitated enemy
* Attacking a retreating army
* Attaching one more punitive rider to a legal settlement
* Demanding additional money from a business partner
* Delivering one last humiliating insult

Your GM should not use a **parting shot**.

You once again **bid** **AP** and use an appropriate **ability** against your opponent. Your GM must agree that the size of your **AP** **bid** is sufficient to gain the additional **prize**. The greater the **prize** the more risk that failure will bring them back into the contest, and so the higher the **bid** must be. If you succeed, their **AP** will decrease; their **outcome** may or may not change, but they cannot finish the **round** by taking an action against you.

**Parting shots** are risky; if you fail, an **AP** transfer might bring your opponent back into the **contest**. Your stumble can give them an opening that they can exploit in an effort to snatch **victory** from the jaws of **defeat**.

### 5.3.5 Desperation Stake

You can stake more **advantage points** than you currently have, to a maximum of your starting **AP** total. This allows you to attempt a **desperation stake** even when you are within a single **AP** of **defeat**. Your GM can never stake more **advantage points** than they have.

### 5.3.6 Asymmetrical Exchange

If you are engaged, you may choose to briefly suspend your attempt to best your opponent in an **extended contest**, in order to do something else. An instance where you are trying to do something else and your opponent is trying to win the **contest** is called an **asymmetrical exchange**.

In an **asymmetrical exchange**, you do not score **APs** against your opponent if you win the **exchange**. Instead, you succeed at whatever else you were doing. You still lose **AP** if you fail. Often you will be using an **ability** other than the one you've been waging the **contest** with, one better suited to the task at hand. This becomes additionally dangerous when the **score** associated with your substitute **ability** is significantly lower than the one used for the rest of the **contest**.

In addition to secondary objectives, as in the above example, you may engage in **asymmetrical exchange** to grant **augments** (see §2.6) to yourself or others.

### 5.3.7 Switching Abilities

You can usually switch freely from one **ability** to another in the middle of an **extended contest**. It makes sense to do so if you think a different **ability** will yield an advantage. 

Your **AP** total stays the same when you change your **ability**, so it makes sense to start the contest with your best **ability** (appropriate to your goal, of course). If this seems odd, remember that **advantage points** measure advantage—how well the character is doing in the contest at the current moment. They do not measure proficiency; that is what the **target number** is for.

When you switch **abilities**, your **prize** does not change, just the means by which you pursue it.

### 5.3.8 Disengaging

To disengage from an **extended contest** when your opponent is actively trying to keep you in the conflict, use an **asymmetrical exchange** (see ±5.3.6). You use an **ability** relevant to your attempt to disengage; the opponent counters with the **resistance** or, if a PC, an appropriate **ability**. If the GM attempts to disengage, they use the **resistance** to do so. These **abilities** may or may not be those used in the main **contest**.

On any **victory**, you are able to leave the **contest**.

If you withdraw from a **group extended contest** and later decide to rejoin it (or are forced to), you rejoin with the **advantage point** total you had when you left. If you can show how your leaving and returning substantially changes the situation, the GM may restore some of your **AP**—for example, if you leave a street fight to get your **followers** from a nearby tavern. Leaving a **contest** just to pick up a weapon or catch your breath is an **unrelated action**, and does not change your **advantage points**.

### 5.3.9 AP Gifting

If you are uninvolved in the contest you can also increase a participant’s **AP** total. First, agree the **tactic** you are using to help the engaged participant. Second, figure your **APs** from that ability (see §5.3.2.1). You **bid** a number of **APs** which may not exceed your **target number**. The **resistance** is twice the **bid**. 

On a **victory** you transfer that number to the participant. On a **defeat** you transfer that number to the participant's opponent.

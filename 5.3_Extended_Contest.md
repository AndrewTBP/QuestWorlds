## 5.3 Extended Contest

**Extended contests** are longer and more dramatic than **simple contests**. Your GM uses **extended contests** when the **outcome** of the struggle is important, to generate suspense for the players, or when they want a back-and-forth struggle. It is something you and your GM should visualize and describe.

An **extended contest** consists of one or more **rounds**, in which you perform actions that are similar to **simple contests**. However, actions and **rounds** do not decide the **outcome** of the whole **contest**, only who gains or loses **advantage points (AP)** at that time. You take actions in turn, an **exchange**, losing and gaining the advantage, until either you or your opponent runs out of **advantage points** and is **defeated**.

### 5.3.1 Procedure

1. Your GM **frames the contest**.
2. You choose a **tactic**, and figure your PC's **target number** (**TN**) using the **rating** of your **ability**, plus or minus **modifiers** the GM may give you. Figure your starting **advantage point (AP)** total using the **TN**, including all **modifiers** and **augments**. The **AP** include +20 for each level of **mastery**, and can also be increased by **followers**.
3. The GM determines the **resistance**. The GM opposes the PC with a **resistance**—the harder the task or tougher the opponent, the higher the **resistance**. The GM figures starting **APs** for the **resistance** from the **resistance** **TN**.
4. Carry out one or more **rounds**, repeating as necessary.
    1. Each **round** consists of two **exchanges**: an action and immediate response.
        1. Describe your action towards the desired **prize**, what **ability** you use, and how much risk you take. “I want to climb straight up to that outcrop, taking chances if needed.” You can specify your **AP bid**; if you do not, your GM determines this based on the amount of risk you are taking. The size of the **bid** mirrors how bold and risky your character’s action is. Extreme or aggressive actions mean a high **AP bid**, and cautious actions require less.
        2. The **ability** used can be varied, but **APs** are always calculated on the first **ability** that you use in a contest. That **ability** must be used in the first **round**.
        3. You gamble a number of your **APs** in an attempt to reduce your opponent’s **AP**, but if you fail the attempt you lose the **AP**.
        4. Roll a die to determine your **degree of victory or defeat**, then apply any **bumps**. Your GM does the same.
        5. Compare the results of the two die rolls on the Extended Contest Table to determine who loses **AP**; only when you have a **critical** can you gain **AP** from your opponent. The **AP bid** is multiplied by this number before applying the results. Thus, if you **bid** 3 **AP** and the result is “Loser loses 2x **bid**,” the loser loses 3 x 2 = 6 **AP**. Round half points up.
        6. Determine **outcome**. Each contestant’s **AP** total rises or falls during the contest as they gain the upper hand or are driven back. **Exchanges** continue until one contestant reaches 0 **advantage points** or fewer. At that point, the contest is over (even if it is the middle of a **round**). The loser’s final **AP** total determines the **outcome** for the victor.
        7. The GM then hazards a number of **APs** for the **resistance**, in the same way.
5. **Advantage points** are only relevant for the length of a particular **contest**. Your PC does not have any until the next **extended contest** begins, when you calculate them all over again

### EXTENDED CONTEST TABLE

||Critical|Success|Failure|Fumble|
|:------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|
|Critical|Worse roll transfers ½x bid, else tie**|Loser transfers 1x bid**|Loser transfers 2x bid**|Loser transfers 3x bid**|
|Success|Loser transfers 1x bid**|Worse roll loses ½x bid, else tie|Loser loses 1x bid|Loser loses 2x bid**|
|Failure|Loser transfers 2x bid**|Loser loses 1x bid|Worse roll loses ½x bid, else tie|Loser loses 1x bid**|
|Failure|Loser transfers 3x bid**|Loser loses 2x bid|Loser loses 1x bid**| Tie*|
  
* In a **group extended contest**, the GM may declare that both contestants lose 1⁄2x **bid** to indicate that, although their results cancel out with respect to each other, their situation worsens compared to other contestants.
** If the loser has **ability** 6 less than their opponent or worse, do not transfer, loser just loses AP instead.

### 5.3.2 Advantage Points

#### 5.3.2.1  Bidding Advantage Points

 The size of your **AP bid** reflects the risk inherent in your actions. You describe your action and intent, and say how many **APs** you want to **bid**. If you describe an all-out offensive with your sword cutting vicious arcs, you need to bid a lot of **APs**; if you say that you are circling your foe cautiously, a low **bid** is in order. Your GM  will look at the level of risk you are taking, and may suggest that you change your **bid** to better match your actions. If you do not declare a **bid** before rolling the die, your GM will decide how many points are **bid** (using 3 as a default), with riskier actions calling for higher **AP bids**.

#### 5.3.2.3  Followers and Advantage Points

**Followers** can act in different ways during a **contest**, **augmenting** you with their **abilities** or allowing you to use one of your **abilities** as if it were your own. Alternatively, a **follower** with a relevant **ability** or **keyword** can simply add their **APs** to the PC’s at the beginning of the **contest**.

Remember to figure any **modifiers** into your **follower’s** **ability** before adding it to your starting **AP** total.

Neither you nor the GM makes rolls for **followers**. Instead, their actions are subsumed into yours. The **follower’s** relevant **ability** or **keyword** is used solely as a source of **advantage points**.

You can assign your **followers** to someone else, although you may have to succeed at a contest to convince a reluctant follower to go along.

#### 5.3.2.3 Advantage Point Knowledge

Once your opponent has won or lost **APs** during the current contest, you can ask the GM what the opposition's **AP** total is. This is where the element of skill comes in. When choosing how many **APs** to stake, you must weigh the effect they want to gain if you succeed versus the risk you face if the action fails.

### 5.3.3 Extended Contest Outcomes

At the end of the contest the **APs** of the loser determine the **benefits** for the winner or **consequences** for the loser. As with all **contests**, if the contest involved a **resistance**, and not another PC, we care about your **outcome**, win or lose, and the GM should feel free to narrate the **outcome** for the **resistance** depending on their interpretation of your **outcome**, which may not be symmetrical. For example, if the **benefit of victory** for your PC is **pumped** the GM should feel free to interpret what this means for the **resistance**: in a melee they might be dead, in a social contest they might be exiled, or they might surrender in the melee or cede ground in a social contest. Your GM should focus on the **prize** that was agreed when deciding how to narrate the resolution of the contest.

#### EXTENDED CONTEST TABLE

|Final AP Total|Level of Defeat|Consequence for Loser|Benefit for Winner|
|:------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|
|0 to –10 AP|Marginal|Hurt|Fresh|
|–11 to –20 AP|Minor|Impaired|Pumped|
|–21 to –30 AP|Major|Injured|Invigorated|
|–31 or fewer AP|Complete|Dying|Heroic|
  
### 5.3.3 Group Extended Contests

When an **extended contest** involves three or more contestants, it is a **group extended contest**. The conflict is often between two groups; each side wants to knock the other out of the contest by reducing all of its opponents to 0 or fewer **APs**.

Sometimes a contest will be a free-for-all involving three or more groups.

Rounds in a **group extended contest** differ in that the order of resolution is more complicated. At the start of the **round**, you state your action and **AP bid**  and single out one or more opponents. Your GM then determines the order in which the contestants act. Taking surprise, withdrawals, and similar situations into effect, they have three options:

* Contestants can go in order from most daring to least daring **bid**: a reckless **bid** goes before a daring **bid**, as defined in “Bidding Advantage Points” above. Thus, the most heroic actions take precedence, acting in order of decreasing boldness. (In case of a tie, the contestant whose actual **bid** is higher goes first.)

* Contestants can go in order from highest **bid** to lowest: a **bid** of 20 **APs** goes before a **bid** of 5 **APs**. (In case of a tie, the contestant whose **bid** is the most daring goes first.)

* Contestants can go in order from highest to lowest **AP** total. (In case of a tie, the highest or most daring **bid** goes first.)

During a standard **extended contest** an opponent immediately responds to your action with their own, but in a **group extended contest** this is not true—they cannot act (against you or anyone else) until their turn comes. You may want to change your declared action if another character attacks you first, and your GM will normally allow you to do so, usually to return an attack in kind.

The order in which contestants act is also important because a character (whether PC or **resistance** such as an NPC) can be knocked out of the contest before their turn comes. If your chosen opponent is knocked out before your PC acts, the GM decides if you can change your declared action.

You always have the option of delaying and allowing other contestants to act before you. You can jump back into the action at any time during the **round**, although again your GM determines if you can change your stated action.

When all characters still in the contest have completed their action the **round** ends and a new one begins.

#### 5.3.2.5 Group Extended Contest Outcomes

In a **group extended contest** the side that has the last undefeated contestant gains the **prize**.

If the PCs won, determine the group's overall **outcome** by using the second-best **outcome** obtained by the PCs, or if there is only one opponent, the **outcome**. If the PCs lost, determine the group's overall **outcome** by using the second-worst outcome obtained by the PCs, or if there is only one PC, the **outcome**.

*For example, your PC Lieutenant Jackson of the Royal Navy has led a shore-action against a French outpost. Lieutenant Jackson and two other PCs have **victory** **outcomes** at the end of the contest, so the Royal Navy wins the day. To determine how well the Royal Navy has done your GM looks at the three **victorious** **outcomes** for the Royal Navy, a **major victory**, a **minor victory** and a **marginal victory**. The second best outcome is a **minor victory** so your GM declares that the Royal Navy have a **minor victory** and have overrun the French outpost, but gained little else.*

*Later you lead your men in a spirited defense against a French boarding action of your ship. However, the French win the day, with Lieutenant Jackson and the other PCs suffering **defeat** **outcomes** at the end of the **contest**. Looking at your PCs **outcomes** there is a **major defeat**, two **minor defeats** and a **marginal defeat**. The French win the day with a **minor defeat** for your Royal Navy crew.*

To determine individual **consequences** or **benefits**, use the **AP** of last opponent you engaged to determine your individual **outcome**. 

### 5.3.4 Parting Shot

When you **defeat** an opponent in an **extended contest**, you can act again immediately to try to make their **consequences of defeat** more severe. This is called a **parting shot**. You once again **bid** **AP** and use an appropriate **ability** against your opponent. If you succeed, their **AP** will decrease; their **outcome** may or may not change, but they cannot finish the **round** by taking an action against you.

**Parting shots** are risky; if you fail, an **AP** transfer might bring your opponent back into the **contest**. Your stumble can give them an opening that they can exploit in an effort to snatch **victory** from the jaws of **defeat**.

The **consequences of defeat** can remain after a **parting shot**, if the GM chooses. Thus, an opponent might keep a **penalty** from a defeat even if they are handed another chance by their opponent’s failed **parting shot**.

### 5.3.5 Final Action

If your PC falls to 0 or fewer **advantage points** in a standard **extended contest**, you are **defeated**. In a **group extended contest**, however, you can still try a **final action** to stay in the **contest** as long as you are not **dying** (which allows for no actions). A **final action** represents the knack to come back when your opponent turns away to gloat or deal with the other player characters. A character may only attempt one **final action** in any **contest**.

To attempt a **final action**, you must be free from attention by the opposition. You must spend a **hero point**. This does not provide a **bump** up on the roll to come; it is the cost of performing a **final action**. You can use a relevant **ability** in a **simple contest** against the number of **APs** your PC is below 0. Even if you succeed, the original **consequences of defeat** still apply: a **hurt** still takes a –1 to appropriate **abilities** until healed.

If you win the **simple contest**, you rejoin the contest with a positive **AP** total. Your new total is a fraction of your original **AP** total at the outset of the **contest**. If you fail the **simple contest**, your **AP** total drops even further, perhaps worsening your **outcome**.

Your GM should not use a **final action** for the **resistance** (and has no **hero points** which are required for this).

### FINAL ACTION RESULTS TABLE

|Result|AP change|
|:------:|:------:|
|Marginal Victory|Rejoin contest with 1/8 of your starting APs|
|Minor Victory|Rejoin contest with 1/4 of your starting APs|
|Major Victory|Rejoin contest with 1/2 of your starting APs|
|Complete Victory|Rejoin contest with full starting APs|
|Marginal Defeat|Lose APs equal to 1/8 of your starting value|
|Minor Defeat|Lose APs equal to 1/4 of your starting value|
|Major Defeat|Lose APs equal to 1/2 of your starting value|
|Complete Defeat|Lose APs equal to your full starting value|

### 5.3.6 Desperation Stake

You can stake more **advantage points** than you currently have, to a maximum of your starting **AP** total. This allows you to attempt a **desperation stake** even when you are within a single **AP** of **defeat**. Your GM can never stake more **advantage points** than they have.

### 5.3.7 Unrelated Action

If you are unengaged, you can forfeit your action to do something unrelated to the object of the contest. You might want to try to open a door, haul an important piece of equipment out of your saddlebags, heal yourself with magic, or **augment** an **ability**. Depending on the circumstances, you may have to engage in a **simple contest** to find out if you succeed at the **unrelated action**.

## 5.3.8 Asymmetrical Exchange

If you are engaged, you may choose to briefly suspend your attempt to best your opponent in an **extended contest**, in order to do something else. An instance where you are trying to do something else and your opponent is trying to win the **contest** is called an **asymmetrical exchange**.

In an **asymmetrical exchange**, you do not score **APs** against your opponent if you win the **exchange**. Instead, you succeed at whatever else you were doing. You still lose **AP** if you fail. Often you will be using an **ability** other than the one you've been waging the **contest** with, one better suited to the task at hand. This becomes additionally dangerous when the **rating** associated with your substitute **ability** is significantly lower than the one used for the rest of the **contest**.

In addition to secondary objectives, as in the above example, you may engage in **asymmetrical exchange** to grant **augments** (see above) to yourself or others.

### 5.3.9 Switching Abilities

You can usually switch freely from one **ability** to another in the middle of an **extended contest**. It makes sense to do so if you think a different **ability** will yield an advantage. You may need to do an **unrelated action** to switch abilities—for example, when changing weapons or equipment.

Your **AP** total stays the same when you change your **ability**, so it makes sense to start the contest with your best **ability** (appropriate to your goal, of course). If this seems odd, remember that **advantage points** measure advantage—how well the character is doing in the contest at the current moment. They do not measure proficiency; that is what the **target number** is for.

When you switch **abilities**, your **prize** does not change, just the means by which you pursue it.

### 5.3.10 Disengaging

To disengage from an **extended contest** when your opponent is actively trying to keep you in the conflict, take an **unrelated action** to make a **simple contest** roll against the **resistance**. You use an **ability** relevant to your attempt to disengage; the opponent counters with the **resistance** or, if a PC, an appropriate **ability**. If the GM attempts to disengage, they use the **resistance** to do so. These **abilities** may or may not be those used in the main **contest**.

On any **victory**, you are able to leave the **contest**. On any **defeat**, you must remain in the **contest**, and transfer a fraction of your current **APs** to your opponent.

If you withdraw from a **group extended contest** and later decide to rejoin it (or are forced to), you rejoin with the **advantage point** total you had when you left. If you can show how your leaving and returning substantially changes the situation, the GM may restore some of your **AP**—for example, if you leave a street fight to get your **followers** from a nearby tavern. Leaving a **contest** just to pick up a weapon or catch your breath is an **unrelated action**, and does not change your **advantage points**.

### AP TRANSFER FRON FAILED DISENGAGEMENT

|Level of Defeat|AP transferred|
|:------:|:------:|
|Marginal|1/8 of your current total|
|Minor|1/4 of your current total|
|Major|1/2 of your current total|
|Complete|Your current total - 1|

### 5.3.10 AP Lending

**AP lending** is a common and important option in **extended contests**. You can transfer some or all of your **advantage points** to another PC engaged in a **group extended contest** on your side. With more **advantage points**, they can stay in the **contest** for longer, or make larger **bids** without driving themselves to **defeat**.

You cannot lend **advantage points** to yourself.

If a **follower’s AP** are already included in your **AP** total, the **follower** cannot lend them to you.

Use an **unrelated action** and describe what your character is trying to do to improve the position of the target. For example, your PC might throw them a weapon, jeer at an opponent, or simply shout words of encouragement. Then, state the number of **AP** you are trying to **lend**. (The GM may suggest a higher or lower **bid** based on the action you describe.) This determines the **resistance** you face in a **simple contest**, with **outcomes** as determined below. Beware: PCs trying to aid their comrades in this way risk worsening their friend’s position.

### AP LENDING

|Outcome|AP Transferred|
|:------:|:------:|
|Complete Victory|Target gains the attempted AP; lender does not lose AP|
|Major or Minor Victory|Target gains the attempted AP; lender loses the AP|
|Marginal Victory|Target gains ½ the attempted AP; lender loses ½ the attempted AP|
|Tie|No Effect|
|Marginal Defeat|Target gains nothing; lender loses ½ the attempted AP|
|Minor or Major Defeat|Target gains nothing; lender loses the attempted AP|
|Complete|Target and lender each deduct the attempted AP from their totals|

### 5.3.11 AP Gifting

If you are uninvolved in the contest you can also increase a participant’s **AP** total. You **bid** a number of **APs** which may not exceed your **target number**. The **resistance** is twice the **bid**. The amount transferred depend on the **outcome**.

### AP GIFTING

|Outcome|AP Transferred|
|:------:|:------:|
|Complete Victory|Recipient gains 2x bid|
|Major or Minor Victory|Recipient gains bid|
|Marginal Victory|Recipient gains 1/2 of bid|
|Tie|No Effect|
|Marginal Defeat|Recipient’s opponent gains 1/2 bid|
|Minor or Major Defeat|Recipient’s opponent gains bid|
|Complete|Recipient’s opponent gains 2x bids|

### 5.3.12 Edges and Handicaps

Your GM may want rules to represent opponents who strike rarely but with great effect or who strike often but with little impact per blow. The first quality can be represented with an **edge**; the second, with a **handicap**. **Edges** and **handicaps** are designated using ^ (^5, for example), **handicaps** with a minus sign (–^5). 

**Edges** and **handicaps** affect only the **advantage points bid** in an **extended contest**. Your **edge** is added to your **AP bid** when your opponent must **lose** or **transfer APs**. Your **handicap** is subtracted from your bid when your opponent **loses** or **transfers APs**. A contestant’s **edge** or **handicap** never affects his **AP** when he defends, only when he is attacking.

Most GMs find **edges** and **handicaps** more trouble than they’re worth, and depict these phenomena with description alone. Earlier books made more extensive use of **edges** and **handicaps** to represent the quality of equipment carried by the PCs. For example, your suit for chainmail might be ^4 and your sword ^3. In games where restricted access to equipment is a significant part of the setting and your GM wants to use extended contests it may make sense to use them, otherwise we recommend ignoring them

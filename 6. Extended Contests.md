# [Option] Extended Contest
Most conflicts should be resolved using the simple contest rules. However, every so often, you’ll want to stretch out a resolution, breaking it down into a series of smaller actions, increasing the suspense the players feel as they wait to see if they succeed or fail.

## Procedure
1. Frame the contest.
2. Figure the PC's target number (TN) using the ability rating and any modifiers. The PCs TN is the rating of their ability, plus or minus modifiers the GM may give the PC. 
3. The GM determines the resistance. The GM opposes the PC with a resistance—the harder the task or tougher the opponent, the higher the resistance.
4. Carry out one or more rounds, repeating as necessary.
    1. An extended contest unfolds as a series of simple contests. At the end of each simple contest, the winning character (or resistance) scores a number of resolution points (RPs) to his tally, which varies between 1 and 5, depending on the result. Tied results leave the score unchanged.
    2. The number of resolution points the winner garners at the end of each exchange depends on the degree of victory they scored. They get 1 point for a marginal victory, 2 for a minor victory, 3 for a major victory, and 5 for a complete victory. 
    3. The first of the contesting characters to accumulate a total of 5 points wins; their opponent is knocked out of the contest and loses the prize.
5. Determine Degee of Succes based on Rising Action of Climax (below).
6. Determine Benefits of Victory or Consequences of Defeat. 
7. Describe the result based on the agreed prize.

## Rising Action 
Rising action refers to all of the many plot events and complications that occur between the beginning and the climax of a story. During this phase of your story, use the Rising Action Consequence table to assess results.

Find the difference between the winner and loser’s resolution point scores as of the contest’s conclusion. Determine the outcome for the PCs either winner or loser and cross-reference with the following table to find the benefits of victory or lasting consequences.

GROUP SIMPLE CONTEST RESULTS TABLE
| | | | |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | 
|Difference Between Results|Negative Consequences for Loser|Victory/Defeat Level|
|1|Hurt|Marginal|
|2|Hurt|Marginal|
|3|Impaired|Minor|
|4|Imparied|Minor|
|5|Injured|Major|
|6|Injured|Major|
|7|Dying|Complete|
|8|Dead|Complete|
|9|Dead|Complete|


## Climax
For the final, climactic confrontation that wraps up your story, use the following, more punishing method of doling out consequences. 

Take into account all resolution points scored against all participants. Winners and losers alike add up all resolution points scored against them by any opponent. Then the losers add 1 to their totals. The result is then cross-referenced against the Climactic Consequence table.

To determine the winning side’s victory level for a climactic scene, cross-reference with the second-worst consequence among the defeated opponents on the Climatic Scene Victory Level table. If there is only one opponent, use their consequence of defeat.

CLIMACTIC CONSEQUENCE

| ------------- | ------------- |
|Total Resolution Points Scored Against PC|Consequence|
|0|Unharmed|
|1|Dazed|
|2|Hurt|
|3|Hurt|

|3|Hurt|

### Parting Shot
In the round immediately after a PC takes an opponent out of the contest, they may attempt to increase the severity of the consequences the opponent suffers by engaging in a parting shot. This is an attempt (metaphoric or otherwise) to kick the opponent while he’s down:

• Striking an incapacitated enemy
• Attacking a retreating army
• Attaching one more punitive rider to a legal settlement
• Demanding additional money from a business partner
• Delivering one last humiliating insult

Only PCs should use a Parting Shot

If you succeed in your parting shot roll, you add the result from your roll to the final number of Resolution Points scored against the opponent in the exchange that removed him from the contest.

However, if the opponent succeeds, he takes the number of Resolution Points he would, in a standard exchange, score against you, and instead subtracts them from the number of Resolution Points scored against him in the exchange that removed him from the contest. If the revised total is now less than 5, he returns to the contest, and may re-engage you. The Game Master describes this as a dramatic turnaround, in which the victim’s overreaching foe has somehow granted him an advantage allowing him to recover from his previous misfortune. The provisional consequences he suffered now go away, and are treated as a momentary or seeming disadvantage.

The ability the use must relate to the consequences the opposition will suffer, but needn’t be the same one you used to win the contest. If the loser is a PC use a suitable ability to resist; otherwise the GM rolls a suitable resistance value.

Where it makes sense in the narrative, unengaged characters may attempt parting shots against opponents taken out of the contest by third parties. Characters may not revive their teammates by using their lamest abilities to make parting shots on them; this, by definition, does not pass a credibility test.

#### Asymmetrical Exchanges
A PC may choose to briefly suspend their attempt to best their opponent in an extended contest, in order to do something else. An instance where one contestant is trying to win the contest and another is trying to do something else is called an asymmetrical exchange. In an asymmetrical exchange, a PC pursuing an objective other than victory does not score points against the other if he wins the exchange. Instead, he gains some other advantage. He still loses points if he fails. Often he will be using an ability other than the one he’s been waging the contest with, one better suited to the task at hand. This becomes additionally dangerous when the rating associated with the substitute ability is significantly lower than the one used for the rest of the contest.
In addition to secondary objectives, as in the above example, heroes may engage in asymmetrical exchanges to grant augments (see above) to themselves or others. 

#### Disengaging
A PC can always abandon a contest, but, in addition to losing their prize under contention, they may also suffer negative consequences. Many contests will have no stakes other than the mutual intent to harm one another—each contestant is trying to attach negative consequences to the other. In such instances, the PC will always suffer negative consequences if they simply withdraw, unless they successfully disengage.

To disengage, a PC makes an asymmetrical exchange, usually using the ability relevant to the contest they’re trying to wriggle out of. If they fail, their effort is wasted and the score against them increases, as it would have during a normal exchange. If they succeed, they escape the clutches, literal or metaphorical, of their opponent, without further harm.

If a PC disengages from a contest during the rising action, they suffer no consequences from it. In a climactic scene, however, Resolution Points scored during contests the PC disengaged from are still taken into account when determining consequences. In the case of a group contest, consequences against a PC are determined as soon as they disengage.

# [Option] Group Extended Contest
Group extended contests proceed as a series of extended contests between pairs of PC and opponents, interwoven so that they happen nearly simultaneously.

As in an extended contest between a single PC and an opponent, only one exchange per pair of adversaries occurs each round. Usually the PCs make up one team, and their antagonists the other.

## Procedure
1. Frame the contest.
2. Figure the PC's target number (TN) using the ability rating and any modifiers. The PCs TN is the rating of their ability, plus or minus modifiers the GM may give the PC. 
3. The GM determines the resistance. The GM opposes the PC with a resistance—the harder the task or tougher the opponent, the higher the resistance.
4. Allow the PCs to choose their opponents in order of their TN where it makes sense. Otherwise allocate opponents to the PCs dependent on what makes narrative sense.
5. Establish an order of the paired contests. There is no significant advantage to going first, but use the PC's TN from highest to lowest if no other option presents itself
6. For each pairing carry out one round. Then repeat by carrying out more rounds in order, as necessary. The group extended contest ends as soon as there are no active participants on one side of the conflict. The side with one or more participants left standing wins.
    1. An extended contest unfolds as a series of simple contests. At the end of each simple contest, the winning character (or resistance) scores a number of resolution points (RPs) to his tally, which varies between 1 and 5, depending on the result. Tied results leave the score unchanged.
    2. The number of resolution points the winner garners at the end of each exchange depends on the degree of victory they scored. They get 1 point for a marginal victory, 2 for a minor victory, 3 for a major victory, and 5 for a complete victory. 
    3. The first of the contesting characters to accumulate a total of 5 points wins; their opponent is knocked out of the contest and loses the prize.
        1. As one of a pair is eliminated from the group contest, their victorious opponents may then move on to engage new targets, starting new contests, which are then added to the end of the existing sequence.
        2. If participating in multiple pairings, each pairing is the first to 5 points, points already scored do not count. But the accumulated points do count when determining consequences in the Climatic phase.
5. Determine Degee of Succes based on Rising Action of Climax (above).
6. Determine Benefits of Victory or Consequences of Defeat. 
7. Describe the result based on the agreed prize.

### Unrelated Actions
A PC not currently enmeshed in an exchange—either after a successful disengagement, or after winning an exchange—may take actions within the scene that do not directly contribute to the defeat of the other side. These unrelated actions may grant an augment to themselves or to a teammate. They may achieve a secondary story objective. They resemble asymmetrical exchanges, except that; as they are performed by PCs who are
not targeted by any opponents, they impose no additional risk.

### Assists
A PC may take an unrelated action to grant an assist to a teammate enmeshed in an exchange. To make an assist, a hero engages in a simple contest, either against a suitable difficulty, or an applicable ability of an affected opponent.

Assists are subject to the same restrictions as augments: they must be both credible and interesting.

By default, a PC making assists face Moderate Difficulty. Each subsequent assist attempt to the same beneficiary, steps up by one factor on the table: high, then very high, then nearly impossible.

The difficulty escalation occurs even when a new hero steps in to make a subsequent assist. In rules terms, this escalation allows the occasional dramatic rescue but makes it difficult for the players to prolong losing battles to excruciating length. 

Dramatically, it emulates the constant raising of the stakes inherent in a suspenseful scene. Like other
HeroQuest Glorantha rules structures, the limitation mirrors a literary conceit, not a literal reality. The
Game Master makes it seem credible by justifying the increasing difficulties with descriptions of ever-escalating countermeasures on the part of the opposition.

Game Masters should feel free to adjust the starting difficulty up or down by one step to account for campaign credibility or other dramatic factors. If an assist as proposed seems too improbable or insufficiently useful, Game Masters should collaborate with players to propose alternate suggestions which would face Moderate Difficulty.

The assist alters the score against your teammate according to the result of a simple contest

ASSIST RESULTS
| | |
| ------------- | ------------- |
|Contest Outcome|Change to Score Against Recipient|
|Complete Victory|-4|
|Major Victory|-3|
|Minor Victory|-2|
|Marginal Victory|-1|
|Marginal Defeat|0|
|Minor Defeat|+1|
|Major Defeat|+2|
|Complete Defeat|+3|

Scores in exchanges can never be reduced below 0.

### Followers
Players may choose to have their PC's followers take part in group extended contests in one of three ways: as full contestants, as secondary contestants, or as supporters.

**Contestant**: The follower takes part in the contest as any other PC would. Players roll for their followers as they would their main characters. However, followers are removed from the contest whenever 3 Resolution Points are scored against them in a given exchange. An additional 2 Resolution Points are then scored against them, increasing the severity of any consequences they suffer.

**Secondary contestant**: To act as a secondary contestant, the follower must have an ability relevant
to the contest. The follower sticks by the hero’s side, contributing directly to the effort: fighting in a battle, tossing in arguments in a legal dispute, acting as the ship’s navigator, or whatever. Although the player and GM describe this, the player does not roll for the follower. Instead, these efforts benefit the
main hero in two ways:
* When confronted by multiple opponents, the main hero may ignore the multiple opponent penalty for one foe for each follower acting as a secondary contestant.
* The main hero may, at any point, shift any number of Resolution Points to a follower acting as a secondary contestant. Followers with 3 or more points lodged against them are removed from the scene. When a follower is removed from the scene, an additional 2 Resolution Points are lodged against them, increasing the severity of consequences they suffer. The main hero loses the protection against multiple opponents afforded by the follower.

**Supporter**: The follower is present in the scene, but does not directly engage the main hero’s opponents. Instead he may perform assists and other unrelated actions.

Followers acting in any of these three capacities may be removed from the contest by otherwise unengaged opponents. To remove a follower from a scene, an opponent engages the follower in a simple contest of relevant abilities. On any failure, the follower is taken out of the contest. For consequence determination purposes, the follower has X+2 Resolution Points lodged against him, where X is the usual number levied by the Resolution Point table.

### Risky Gambits
During an extended contest, a hero can attempt to force a conflict to an early resolution by making a risky gambit. If the PC trying a risky gambit wins the exchange, they lodge an additional 1 Resolution Point against their opponent. However, if the PC trying the risky gambit loses the exchange, their opponent lodges an additional 2 Resolution Points against them.

If both contestants engage in a risky gambit, the winner lodges an additional 2 Resolution Points against the loser.

### Defensive Responses
In an extended contest, a PC can make a defensive response, lowering the number of Resolution Points lodged against the losing party to an exchange. If the hero wins the exchange, the number of Resolution Points lodged against his opponent decreases by 1. If the hero loses, he lodges 2 fewer Resolution Points against his opponent. The total number of Resolution Points assigned by an exchange is never less than 0; there is no such thing as a negative Resolution Point.

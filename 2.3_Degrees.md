## 2.3 Degrees

Your GM uses a scale known as **degrees** throughout the game. **Degree** represent the scale of a **contest** **outcome** (ยง2.4.7), an **augment** (see ยง2.6), **stretches** and **situational modifiers** (see ยง2.5), **benefits** and **consequences** (see ยง2.8). Your GM also uses the same **degree** as a modifier to a **base resistance** when determining the **resistance's** **TN**.

To add to the dice roll use the scale of values: +5, +10, +15, +M, +M2
To subtract from the dice roll use the scale of values: -5, -10, -15, -M, -M2

So  *zero* **degrees** is +5 or -5, *one* **degree**  is +10 or -10, and so on. It is usually clear but you can use *decreasing* **degree** to refer to a subtraction and *higher* **increasing** to refer to an addition.

## 3.7 Prose Method

You write a paragraph of text like you would see in a story outline, describing the most essential elements of your character. Include **keywords**, personality traits, important possessions, relationships, and anything else that suggests what you can do and why. The paragraph should be about 100 words long.

Compose the description in complete, grammatical sentences. No lists of **abilities**; no sentence fragments. Your GM may choose to allow sentences like the previous one for emphasis or rhythmic effect, but not simply to squeeze in more cool things you can do.

Once your narrative is finished, convert the description into a set of **abilities**. Mark any **keywords** with double underlines. Mark any other word or phrase that could be an **ability** with a single underline. Then write these **keywords** and **abilities** on your character sheet.

There is no limit to the number of **abilities** you can gain from a single sentence, as long as the sentence is not just a list of **abilities**. If your GM decides a sentence is just a list, they may allow the first two **abilities**, or they may tell the player to rewrite the sentence. Note, however, that you cannot specify more than one **sidekick** in your prose description.

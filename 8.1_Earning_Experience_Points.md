## 8.1 Earning Experience Points

You gain one **experience points** for any of the following:

* When your **outcome** for a **contest** is a **defeat**.
* Your GM uses a **flaw** or other **ability** against you in a contest with you (see ยง2.6). This happens either when the story forced you to confront a **flaw**, or the GM gave you a **hindrance** (see ยง3.4), if the **hindrance** results in a **penalty**.

You do not gain **experience points** if any of the following apply:

* You can only gain one **experience point** in total from any source for a single **contest** be that **hindrance** or **defeat**.
* You only gain an **experience point** for each of your **abilities** once in a session of game play. Repeated **defeats** with the same ability teach you nothing else; you gain no further **experience points** for that **ability** until the next session. 
* In a **long contest** if you have earned **experience points** for *any* ability you used during the contest, you cannot gain **experience points** for that contest.
* You do not get **experience points** for an **augment**, **AP gifting** or **assist**.
* You can only gain an **experience point** from an individual **flaw** or **ability** being used against you once per session. Repeated invocations of a **flaw** or use of an **ability** against you teach you nothing else; you gain no further **experience points** for that **flaw** or **ability** until the next session.
* You do not gain an **experience point** from an **assured contest**, even if you roll to determine **benefits** or **consequences**.

You can gain a maximum of five **experience points** in any one session. Once you have earned five **experience points**, you cannot gain further **experience points** in that session. You should usually expect to earn less, and may earn none.

### 8.1.1 Experience on Defeat 

Awarding **experience points** on **defeat** is a self-correction mechanism.

* It slows your advance if your PC regularly outclass the **resistance**. This pushes your GM to introduce threats that **credibly** present a greater threat to your PC.
* If you regularly buy off **defeat** with **story points** you will find it harder to advance. In *QuestWorlds* your GM should provide an entertaining story branch on defeat;  you should not need to buy **defeat** off, unless it damages your character conception

If the GM finds that the PCs are no longer regularly earning **experience points** they can consider using **resistance progression** (see ยง2.8) to increase the **base resistance** so that more **contests** will feature a high enough resistance to earn **experience points**.

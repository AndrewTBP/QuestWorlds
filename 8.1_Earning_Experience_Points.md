## 8.1 Earning Experience Points

You gain one **experience points** for any of the following:

* When your **result** for using an ability is a **failure** in a **contest**.
* Your GM uses a **flaw** or other **ability** against you in a contest with you (see ยง2.6). This happens either when the story forced you to confront a **flaw**, or the GM gave you a **hindrance** (see ยง3.4), if the **hindrance** results in a **penalty**.

You do not gain **experience points** if any of the following apply:

* You can only gain one **experience point** in total from any source for a single **contest** be that **hindrance** or **failure**.
* You only gain one **experience point** the first time your **result** is a **failure** to use that ability in a session; repeated **failures** to use the same ability teach you nothing else and you gain no further **experience points** for that **ability** until the next session.
* You can only gain an **experience point** from an individual **flaw** or **ability** being used against you once per session. repeated invocations of a **flaw** or use of an **ability** against you teach you nothing else and you gain no further **experience points** for that **flaw** or **ability** until the next session.
* You do not learn from a **fumble** and so you do not gain an **experience points** when you **fumble**.
* If you **bump** your **failure**, through a **mastery** or **story point**, you do not gain an **experience point**.
* If you **bump** a **fumble** to a **failure**, through a **mastery** or **story point**, it does not grant you an **experience point**.
* You do not gain an **experience point** from an **assured contest**, even if you roll to determine **benefits** or **consequences**.

For clarity:

* If you earn a **victory** in a **contest** because you and your opponent both have a **failure result** but you have the **better roll** you still gain an **experience point**. You have an opportunity to learn from your mistake, even if your opponent could not take advantage of it.

You can gain a maximum of five **experience points** in any one session. Once you have earned five **experience points**, you cannot gain further **experience points** in that session. You should usually expect to earn less, and may earn none.

Note that if you have a **mastery** in your **ability**, you will need to contend against a **resistance** that also has a **mastery** to learn by a **failure**. When **masteries** 'cancel out', you can once again roll a **failure** result that is not **bumped** giving you the opportunity to learn. You may also choose to use **abilities** that do not have a **mastery** even if an **ability** with a **mastery** could apply, as **failure** with them will lead to your gaining a **experience point**.

As your **ability** ratings improve, you will gain fewer **experience points**, and you will improve your **abilities** less frequently, unless you take on greater challenges. This is by design. Your GM should craft stories that provide greater challenges to experienced PCs to allow them the opportunity to earn **experience points**.

Burning a **story point** to gain a **bump** prevents you from gaining an **experience point** from that **failure**. Sometimes you may need to trade-off between a **failure** from which you can learn, and a **success** which brings you closer to your goal. In part, this rule exists to dissuade you from always seeking to spend a **story point** to edit out a **failure**.

### 8.1.1 Experience on Failure

Awarding **experience points** on **failure** is used for balance. It slows the advance of PCs who continually use **abilities** that have a **mastery** over the **resistance** and thus offer no threat or challenge. This pushes either your GM to introduce threats that **credibly** present a greater threat to your PC, or pushes you to use some of your lower **rated** **abilities** as your **tactic** in a **contest** to earn **experience points**. It also means that a new PC will earn more **experience points** through increased **failures** over established PCs and begin to catch them up.

If the GM finds that the PCs are no longer regularly earning **experience points** they can consider using **resistance progression** (see ยง2.8) to increase the **base resistance** so that more **contests** will feature a high enough resistance to earn **experience points**.

Your GM may opt not to use **resistance progression** if they feel that a certain level of advancement your PCs will become mostly static and not improve their **abilities**.

## 8.3 Changes to Resource Ratings

At the end of your GM's chosen interval, they review the Resource Notation Table.

Any **resource** with a **bonus** of 3 or more in its PC column increases by 1 for each 3 points of **bonus**, for a maximum increase of 3.

Any **resource** with a **penalty** in its Total column decreases by 1 for each 3 points of **penalty**, for a maximum loss of 2.

Any remaining **modifiers** are now reduced to 0.

The GM now start a new Resource Notation Table, with **resource ratings** altered to reflect any changes from the above process.

Having made permanent changes to the communityâ€™s **resource ratings**, your GM then restarts the cycle by again testing for a new set of **background events**.

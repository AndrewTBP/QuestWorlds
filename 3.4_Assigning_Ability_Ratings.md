## 3.4 Assigning Ability Scores

You have now defined your **abilities** and **flaws**. These tell everyone what you can do. 

Now assign numbers to each **ability**, called **scores**, which determine how well you can do these things.

Assign a starting **score** of 17 to the **ability** you find most important or defining. Although most players consider it wisest to assign this **scores** to their **occupational keyword**, you don’t have to do this. Assign a **score** of 17 to your **distinguishing characteristic**.

All other **abilities** start at a **score** of 13.

A **breakout** from a **keyword** starts at +1. In some cases, you may treat your **distinguishing characteristic** as a **breakout ability** from a **keyword** in this case, treat it as a +4.

**Flaws** are assigned a **score** equivalent to your **abilities**. The first **flaw** is rated at the highest **ability**, the second shares the same **score** as the second-highest **ability**, and the third equals the lowest **ability**. All **flaws** after the third are given the same **score** as the lowest **ability**. You may designate **flaws** from **keywords** as your first or second-ranked **flaw**.

Now spend up to 20 points to increase any of your various **scores**, including **keywords**. Each point spent increases a **score** by 1 point. You can’t spend more than 10 points on any one **ability**.

Some genre packs may require you to have additional **keywords** that reflect the setting. These additional **keywords** come from the 12 **abilities** allowance, so in many genres you will have fewer wildcard **abilities** but better fit the setting.

## 7.1 Bump with Story Points

You can burn a **story point** to gain a **bump** (see ยง2.3.7).

Normally, your GM should ensure that **defeat** takes the story for your PC in an interesting new direction. Unlike some games, where your goal is to win against challenges set by the GM, in a storytelling game your goal is to tell a good story together. Just as in fiction the protagonist can suffer all sorts of reversals, so in a storytelling game, your PC should suffer all sorts of adversities before they triumph (or meet their tragic end). As a result, we recommend against the tendency to 'buy off **defeat**' with **story points**. Instead, **burn** **story points** to **bump** when **defeat** would damage the conception of the character that you have been building during the story. If **defeat** sticks in your throat, because it makes a mockery of *who* your PC is, then use a **bump** to edit the story to a more favorable outcome. Otherwise, 'roll with the punches.'

# Relationships
Abilities may represent the relationship of the PC to supporting characters.

## Supporting Characters
Many relationships connect the PC to supporting characters controlled by the Game Master.

When the PC tries to use one of these relationships to solve a problem, they contest with their relationship ability. The PC can’t simply go to the supporting character they have a relationship with, stick them with the problem, and expect to see it solved.

If the PC succeeds, the supporting character helps them solve the problem. If they fail, they don’t. As with any ability, the player must still specify how the contact goes about overcoming the obstacle. Calls on relationships are almost always simple contests.

In crucial situations, it may seem dramatically inappropriate for a PC to solve a problem indirectly, by working through others. The Game Master can expose the supporting character to serious risk. If the character dies or otherwise suffers a change of status that renders him useless to the PC, the PC permanently loses the relationship ability. 

Before putting supporting characters at serious risk, Game Masters should make sure the players understand the magnitude of the possible consequences. 

When supporting characters undertake significant risk, the supporting character may suffer a consequence of defeat commensurate with the level of the defeat in the contest. Or
it may simply be the PC’s relationship with that is damaged or destroyed.

## Allies
An ally is a character of roughly the same level of accomplishment as the PC, often in the same or a similar line of work. For every favor a PC asks of them, they’ll ask one of them. These reciprocal favors will be roughly equivalent in terms of risk, time commitment, difficulty, and inconvenience.

## Patrons
Patrons enjoy greater access to resources than the PC, either through personal ownership (as in a Merchant Prince) or authority (as in the governnor of a province). They may lend the PC advice or provide them with resources but are too busy and important to personally perform tasks for them. They may hire the PC to do jobs, or issue orders within a command structure to which they both belong.  

When a PC rolls their Patron relationship, the Game Master adjusts the difficulty depending on what
the PC has done for them lately.

## Contacts
A contact is a specialist in an occupation, skill, or area of expertise. Contacts provide information and perform minor favors, but will expect information or small favors from the PC in return.

You can describe a contact as being a particular individual, or as a group of similar individuals. 

### Occupational Contacts
Any occupational keyword can be treated as a source of contacts. However, using an occupational keyword as a source of contacts will always be a stretch. To more reliably draw on particular contacts associated with a profession, a PC should take an explicit ability.

## Followers
A follower is a secondary character that travels with the PC and contributes on a regular basis to their success.

There are two types of followers: sidekicks and retainers.

Followers need not be people, or even sentient beings: you can write up a spirit guardian, trusty robot, or companion animal as a follower.

### Sidekick
A sidekick is a secondary character under the player's control. Most of the time they stays at the PC's side to render assistance, but they can also go off and perform errands or missions on their own. 

The PC should give their sidekick a name. They should, when asked, explain how the sidekick came to be
the PC's follower, and why they continues in that role.

Sidekicks start with three abilities, one rated at 17 and the others at 13. Any of these abilities may
be a keyword. At least one of them should indicate a personality trait.

If the sidekick is nonhuman or a member of an unusual culture, one of its three starting abilities
must be its species or culture keyword.

Once the PC has determined the sidekick’s base abilities, they allocate 15 additional points between three of them, spending no more than 10 on any one ability.

These abilities, like those of the PC, can be improved through the expenditure of Hero Points.

A player may use any of the sidekick’s abilities as they would their PC's. The companion can go off
and do things without the PC.

### Replacing Lost Sidekicks
As a sidekick of defeats in which they participated, sidekicks can be killed or leave the PC's
service permanently. 

Defeat in physical contests can lead to literal death. Metaphorical deaths from non-violent contests indicate a break with the main hero. The companion may angrily withdraw from service, but is more likely to sorrowfully retire. You may be able to bring a companion back from metaphorical
death by overcoming story obstacles. These should be difficult, most likely taking the main focus of  entire storyline within the series.

If you lose a companion, you may create a new
one without needing to spend a Hero Point. You
must explain how the new companion has come to
be your new follower.
Heroes with retainers may find it convenient
to promote them to companion status, giving them
names and personalities, with a sudden boost in
abilities and ratings to match.
Retainers
A retainer is a more or less anonymous servant or
helper. You may specify a single retainer, or, where
appropriate to your character concept, an entire
staff of them.

Like any other ability, a retainer ability allows
you to overcome relevant obstacles by engaging in a
contest. Sample retainers include:
• Bodyguards
• Bound spirits
• Mounts
• Servants
Retainers generally regard you with all the affection
and loyalty due to an employer or master. If you treat
them more poorly than is expected for your culture,
the Game Master will increase the difficulty level of
attempts to make use of their talents.
To model the contribution of combat-oriented
retainers, such as bodyguards and spear carriers, to a
fight, use them as an augment to your
ability. Where appropriate, you and
the Game Master describe the
effect their presence has in the
ongoing fight.
Other sorts of servants
can likewise contribute to
non-violent conflicts.
During a conflict in
which you use retainers in
a fight, the Game Master
can rule that consequences
of defeat apply to them.
Retainers who are routinely
Impaired in battle, or Injured
even once, are apt to leave your
service, even when well treated.
Retainers suffering nonviolent
consequences of defeat
are less likely to depart, though
it is still possible.


If you lose retainers for any reason, you can
replace them simply by providing a convincing
explanation of how you go about it. Heroes who
are notoriously hard on their retainers may have to
overcome challenging plot obstacles to find another
band of willing servitors.
Relationships as Flaws
Certain relationships with supporting characters act
as flaws. They impose obligations on you, prompting
the Game Master to present you with obstacles you
have no choice but to overcome.
Dependents
A dependent is a person, usually a family member
or loved one, who requires your aid and protection.
Your Game Master will periodically create storylines
in which the dependent is endangered.
Rather than taking a dependent as a flaw, you
may find it more fruitful to specify the nature of
your relationship as an ability, such as Love for Wife
or Love for Son. That way, you still guide the Game
Master to include the rescue of your loved one as a
story motif, while also getting an ability you can use
as an augment in appropriate situations.

Adversaries
An adversary is a rival, enemy or other individual who
can be relied upon to periodically disrupt your plans.
Your adversary’s goals are probably the opposite
of yours, although he could be a bitter rival within
the same community, organization, or movement.
His antipathy for you is definitely personal, perhaps
rooted in some past clash or slight.
Adversaries needn’t be passively waiting for you
to do things so they can obstruct you. Game Masters
will give them plans and schemes you will discover
and attempt to disrupt.
Because you have defined yourself in part by
your relationship to your adversary, expect your
Game Master to contrive to keep your adversary
alive and kicking, even in circumstances when you
could permanently dispose of similar opponents.
When one member of a group chooses an
adversary, the other heroes usually wind up dealing
with him, too. As such, you should consult with
your fellow players before writing him into your
series. The group may want to specify a single
adversary for the entire party, or group their
disparate adversaries together in the service of a
single organization or cause.

To treat an adversary as an ability, rather than a flaw,
describe your emotional response to him. Examples: Hates Soreel,
Fears Gimgim the Grim, Sworn Vengeance against Yazurkial Blue
Llama. That way, you still inspire the Game Master to add the
plot elements you desire, but can use your antipathy toward the
enemy to augment your target numbers against him.

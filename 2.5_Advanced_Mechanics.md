## 2.5 Advanced Mechanics

You can play *QuestWorlds* with just the basic mechanics and we recommend you start with this simpler set of rules whilst your GM masters the less-familiar ideas like **story obstacles** instead of task resolution, that make *QuestWorlds* different from traditional RPGs.

The advanced mechanics add detail to the Basic mechanics, which add detail, or generate in-game story developments, at the cost of more complexity.

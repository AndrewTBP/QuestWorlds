## 8.2 Drawing on Resources

You can use community **resources** as **abilities** after convincing the community to let you expend precious assets. This requires a preliminary **contest** using a social **ability**, most likely your community relationship. Your GM will use a **moderate resistance** as the baseline, with higher **resistance**s when your proposals seem selfish or likely to fail, and lower ones when everyone but the dullest dolt would readily see their collective benefits. Your GM may increase **resistance**s if your group draws constantly on community **resources** without replenishing them.

The lobbying effort and the actual resource use require framing, a clear description of what you are doing, and other details to bring them to fictional life. You can use **resource abilities** directly, or to **augment** your own **abilities**.

Unlike character abilities, each use of community **resources** temporarily **depletes** it.

On a **victory**, you win the **prize** specified by **contest framing**, and a **penalty** is applied to subsequent uses of the **resource**.

On a **defeat**, you lose the **prize** and an even more severe **penalty** is applied to subsequent **resource** uses. If you fail to secure the **prize** you were seeking, the depletion **penalty** is also applied to your social and community **abilities** when interacting with members of your community. This reflects community displeasure at your fruitless expenditure.

**Penalties** from the Resource Depletion Table replace standard **penalties** for **defeat**, not add to them.

Like other **modifiers** to **resources**, depletion **penalties** end at the end of the current interval. These include **depletion penalties** applied to character **abilities**. However, a **depletion penalty** left unattended at the end of the interval can result in a permanent drop in the relevant **resource**.

If your GM wants resource depletion to lead to longer-lasting social **penalties**, at the cost of some extra bookkeeping, they can have the characters shed a 3-point **penalty** at the end of each interval.

### RESOURCE DEPLETION TABLE

|Contest Outcome|Depletion Penalty    |
|:---------------:|:-----------------:|
|Complete Victory |0                  |
|Major Victory    |-3                 |
|Minor Victory    |-3                 |
|Marginal Victory |-3                 |
|Marginal Defeat  |-6                 |
|Minor Defeat     |-6                 |
|Major Defeat     |-6                 |
|Complete Defeat  |-9                 |
  
### 8.2.1 Required Resource Use

As part of your GM's setting design, they may specify that certain actions in a setting always require the use of a community **resource**. Because the **resource** use is obligatory, it need not meet the usual criteria for entertainment value. Also, when the resource is used as an **augment**, you can also add a second **augment** from some other **ability**, adjudicated according to the standard rules, including entertainment value criteria. (This way, the required **resource** use doesn’t penalize you by forcing you to **augment** with a low-rated **resource** when you could otherwise use a higher-rated **ability**.)

### 8.2.2 Penalties to Resources

Threats to community **resources** act as a spur to PC action. Your GM may rule that the **penalty** from any **outcome** may be applied to a **resource**. (It might at the same time be applied to one or more PC **abilities**.)

When choosing a **penalty** arising from a player **defeat** in a **simple contest**, your GM will use the **consequences of defeat** table. For a **long contest**, the **penalty** corresponds to the second worst **state of adversity** suffered by a defeated group member.

If your group voluntarily concede a **contest** by withdrawing, your community suffers **resource depletion** equivalent to a **major defeat**.

### 8.2.3 Bolstering Resources

You can add **bonuses** to **bolster** community **resources** by seeking out and overcoming relevant **story obstacles**, specifying in the **contest framing** that the proceeds of **victory** go the community. If you succeed, **bonuses** from the **benefits of victory** table are applied to a resource instead of one or more character abilities. (Your GM may rule that the bonus also applies to you in social situations that involve community members, reflecting gratitude for their efforts on behalf of the community.)

### 8.2.4 Background Events

Your changes to **resources** take center stage in a series, but in the background all sorts of other events periodically alter the community’s prosperity. These include the actions of other community members, who are **depleting and bolstering resources** all the time, as well as the unexpected intrusion of outside forces.

At the beginning of each interval, one of your group should perform a **simple contest** of each **resource** against a **resistance** equal to the average value of all **resources**. These **contests** simulate **background events** outside of your control or influence; they can’t be **augmented** or **bumped** up with **hero points**.

The **outcome** of the **contest** may apply a **modifier** to a **resource**, as per the following table:

### RESOURCE FLUCTUATION TABLE

|Outcome          |Depletion Penalty  |
|:---------------:|:-----------------:|
|Complete Victory |+9                 |
|Major Victory    |+6                 |
|Minor Victory    |+3                 |
|Marginal Victory |0                  |
|Marginal Defeat  |0                  |
|Minor Defeat     |-3                 |
|Major Defeat     |-6                 |
|Complete Defeat  |-9                 |  

Except where your group is exceptionally keen on tracking **resources**, your GM should skip the **background events** process when the PCs are long absent from home. Your GM should rejigger them to serve their plot purposes when they return. The GM may also want to shuffle this process offstage when the PCs are occupied by epic events. This prevents them from having to flee from a climactic plot development to go home and tend to the beet crop.

### 8.2.5 Crisis Tests

When **resources** endure **penalties**, you conduct a **crisis test** at the beginning of each game session to see if trouble strikes the community. A high but **penalized rating** can still lead to crisis, because people have adjusted to the equilibrium it offers and feel squeezed when it shifts on them.

A **crisis test** is a **simple contest** (one for each **penalized ability**) of the **resource rating** against a **resistance** equal to the average of all **resource ratings**. Like **background event** checks, these can’t be **augmented** or **bumped** up by player action. On any **defeat**, the community starts to visibly suffer.

Your GM invents the specific reasons for each fluctuation and narrates them to you.

**Crisis tests** should spur you to action, challenging you to find ways to **bolster** the affected **resources** (see above). When **bolstered**, the **crisis** is reversed. If you neglect your duties or fail, the **crisis** worsens.

Your GM will call for **crisis tests** only as needed, as a tool to generate story. If your group already has enough story on its hands, your GM will suspend them until you next need a new plot hook.

### 8.2.6 Cementing Benefits of Background Events

**Bonuses** from **background events** are temporary, unless you take steps to **cement your benefits**. Doing so requires you to overcome a major **story obstacle**, perhaps taking focus for an evening’s worth of play. If you succeed, the **background event bonus** may, as per the next section, later solidify into a permanent increase in the **resource’s rating**.

When you **cement a background bonus**, your GM changes their notation of that **bonus**.

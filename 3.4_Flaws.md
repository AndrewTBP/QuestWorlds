## 3.4 Flaws

You may assign up to three **flaws** to their PC. Common flaws include:

* Personality traits: surly, petty, compulsive.
* Physical challenges: blindness, lameness, diabetes.
* Social hurdles: outcast, ill-mannered, hated by United supporters.

**Flaws** are assigned a **score** equivalent to your **abilities**. The first **flaw** is rated at the highest **ability**, the second shares the same **score** as the second-highest **ability**, and the third equals the lowest **ability**.

Certain **keywords** include **flaws**. **Flaws** gained through **keywords** do not count against the limit of three chosen  **flaws**. All **flaws** after the third are given the same **score** as the third **ability**. You may designate **flaws** from **keywords** as your first or second-ranked **flaw**. When **flaws** manifest during play, your GM places you in a **contest** against them, and rolls their associated **scores** as **resistances** to your efforts. This method applies to **flaws** that primarily present you with additional **story obstacles** to overcome.

During play your GM may decide that your **flaw** has been triggered. If you chose to act according to your **flaw** it is treated as an **assured contest** that you lose. As with other **assured contests** your GM may still call for you to roll to determine how badly the **flaw** impacts you. If you wish to act against your **flaw** you must obtain a **victory** in a **contest** against your **flaw**. You should describe your heroic attempts to overcome your instincts. If you do not contest your **flaw** or you lose a **contest** with your flaw, your GM determines any **consequences** you suffer from acting out your flaw (see ยง2.6). Your GM may impose a **penalty** if you gain the **victory** against your **flaw** representing your struggle against your inner nature or letting down dependents. Similarly, your GM might give you a **bonus** for acting according to your **flaw**. representing the sacrifices you have made for dependents or a temporary boost from satisfying your inner demons.

When your GM exercises your flaw, you gain **hero points** (see ยง7.1).

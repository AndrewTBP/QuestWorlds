## 3.4 Flaws

You may assign up to three **flaws** to their PC. Common flaws include:

* Personality traits: surly, petty, compulsive.
* Physical challenges: blindness, lameness, diabetes.
* Social hurdles: outcast, ill-mannered, hated by United supporters.

**Flaws** are assigned a **rating** equivalent to your **abilities**. The first **flaw** is rated at the highest **ability**, the second shares the same **rating** as the second-highest **ability**, and the third equals the lowest **ability**.

Certain **keywords** include **flaws**. **Flaws** gained through **keywords** do not count against the limit of three chosen  **flaws**. All **flaws** after the third are given the same **rating** as the third **ability**. You may designate **flaws** from **keywords** as your first or second-ranked **flaw**. When **flaws** manifest during play, your GM places you in a **contest** against them, and rolls their associated **ratings** as **resistances** to your efforts. This method applies to **flaws** that primarily present you with additional **story obstacles** to overcome.

Your GM may decide during play that certain **flaws** are better expressed as **penalties** to your attempts to overcome other **resistances**. Divide the value by 5 and round (a **flaw** of 19 imposes a –4 **penalty**). This is appropriate where the player specifies that your **ability** to solve problems drops under certain specific conditions. Examples might include:

* Tongue-tied in large gatherings.
* Lousy with a stick shift.
* Can’t stand snakes.

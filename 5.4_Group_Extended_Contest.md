## 5.4 Group Extended Contests

When an **extended contest** involves three or more contestants, it is a **group extended contest**. The conflict is often between two groups; each side wants to knock the other out of the contest by reducing all of its opponents to 0 or fewer **APs**.

Sometimes a contest will be a free-for-all involving three or more groups.

### 5.4.1 Procedure

1. Your GM **frames the contest**.
2. You choose a **tactic**, and figure your PC's **target number** (**TN**) using the **score** of your **ability**, plus or minus **modifiers** the GM may give you. Figure your starting **advantage point (AP)** total (see §5.3.2.1).
3. The GM determines the **resistance**. The GM opposes the PC with a **resistance**—the harder the task or tougher the opponent, the higher the **resistance**. The GM figures starting **APs** for the **resistance** (see §5.3.2.1).
4. You describe your action towards the desired **prize** and bid **APs*** (see §5.3.2.2).
5. The GM describes actions for the resistance and bids **APs** (see §5.3.2.2).
5. The GM determines the order of action from highest **bid** to lowest: a **bid** of 20 **APs** goes before a **bid** of 5 **APs**. (In case of a tie, the contestant whose **bid** is the most daring goes first.)
    1. In order of action 
        1. Decide if you want to defer your action, you can jump back into the order at any point. 
        2. Roll a die to determine your **result**, then apply any **bumps**. Your GM does the same.
        3. Compare the two **results** to determine who loses **AP**; only when you have a **critical** can you gain **AP** from your opponent. (see §5.3.2.3)
        4. If either contestant reaches 0 **advantage points** or fewer, the contest is out of the contest.
6. When all characters still in the contest have completed their action the **round** ends and a new one begins.
7. When one side has reduced all of its opponents to 0 or fewer **APs** the contest ends.

If your chosen opponent is knocked out before your PC acts, the GM decides if you can change your declared action. If you defer your action and jump back in, the GM decides if you can change your declared action. 

### 5.4.2 Group Extended Contest Outcomes

In a **group extended contest** the side that has the last undefeated contestant gains the **prize**.

Your GM may decide that you suffer individual **consequences** or gain individual **benefits** from the **outcome** of the contests you pursued, regardless of whether your team won or lost. You might be on the winning team, but lost your individual **contest** and suffer a **penalty** to ongoing actions as a result. Alternatively, you might be on the losing team, but win your individual **contest** and gain a **benefit** as a result. If your team lost, your **benefit** should not be the **prize** but instead reflect a side-affect of your individual triumph. Similarly, if your team won, your **consequence** should not limit the **prize** which your team won, but should reflect a side-affect of your individual loss.

See §5.3.3 for a discussion of **consequences** and **benefits** in **scored contests**.

### 5.4.3 Second Chance

If your PC falls to 0 or fewer **advantage points** in a standard **extended contest**, you are **defeated**. In a **group extended contest**, however, you can try a **second chance** to stay in the **contest**. A **second chance** represents the knack to come back when your opponent turns away to gloat or deal with the other player characters. A character may only attempt one **second chance** in any **contest**.

To attempt a **second chance**, you must be free from attention by the opposition. You must spend a **story point**. This does not provide a **bump** up on the roll to come; it is the cost of performing a **second chance**. You can use a relevant **ability** in a **simple contest** against the number of **APs** your PC is below 0. Even if you succeed, a **consequences** applies: take a –6 to further actions in this contest.

If you win the **simple contest**, you rejoin the contest with a positive **AP** total. Your new total is a 1/4 of your original **AP** total at the outset of the **contest**, round up.

Your GM should not use a **second chance** for the **resistance**.

Your GM may decide to impost a **consequence** on you, even if you are later victorious in a contest, or your team wins the prize, that represents the adversity you suffered that brought you initially to defeat.

### 5.4.4 AP Lending

**AP lending** is a common and important option in **extended contests**. You can transfer some or all of your **advantage points** to another PC engaged in a **group extended contest** on your side. With more **advantage points**, they can stay in the **contest** for longer, or make larger **bids** without driving themselves to **defeat**.

You cannot lend **advantage points** to yourself.

If a **follower’s AP** are already included in your **AP** total, the **follower** cannot lend them to you.

Use an **unrelated action** and describe what your character is trying to do to improve the position of the target. For example, your PC might throw them a weapon, jeer at an opponent, or simply shout words of encouragement. Then, state the number of **AP** you are trying to **lend**. (The GM may suggest a higher or lower **bid** based on the action you describe.) This determines the **resistance** you face in a **simple contest**. You lost the **APs** whether or not you **succeed** in the contest.

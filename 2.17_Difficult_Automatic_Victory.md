## 2.17 Difficult Automatic Victory

Two distinct methods allow your GM to create a sense of difficulty without allowing for the prospect of **failure**: the **arduous automatic victory**, and the **costly automatic victory**. Your GM will use a **costly automatic victory** where **failure** offers no entertaining plot branches, but when they still want the group to work for victory. In a **costly automatic victory**, you succeed, but at a price.

### 2.17.1 Arduous Automatic Victory

Your GM will use an **arduous automatic victory** to help with pacing. They will simply allow you to succeed without a **contest**, and then describe in sweat-inducing detail your hard-won **victory**. Unlike the standard **automatic victory**, the objective here is not to make you feel competent (though it may do that as well) but to emphasize the rigors of your grueling task, preserving suspension of disbelief.

### 2.17.2 Costly Automatic Victory

Your GM may use a **costly automatic victory** where **failure** offers no entertaining plot branches, but they still want you to work for **victory**. In a **costly automatic victory**, you succeed, but at a price.

Even if you suffer a **defeat**, you still overcome the **story obstacle**. You also, however, suffer a **state of adversity** to one or more **abilities**, in keeping with the **defeat** level, as per the **consequences of defeat** table.

The **state of adversity** might apply, as in an ordinary **contest**, to the abilities you used in that **contest**. Usually, though, they apply to some other resource-related **ability**, which may come to haunt you later on. When in doubt, ask yourself if the **penalty** will cripple the group in dealing with **contests**.

## 2.1 Abilities

Characters in *QuestWorlds* are defined by the **abilities** they use to face the challenges that arise in the course of their story. Rather than having a standard list of attributes, skills, powers, etc. for all characters, anything that you can apply to solve a problem or overcome a **story obstacle** could be one of your **abilities**. While your GM may provide some example **abilities** to choose from that connect your PC to a particular story or game world (whether created by your GM or by the designer of a particular game), you get to make up and describe most or all of your **abilities**.

Some **abilities** might be broad descriptions of your background or expertise, like "Dwarf of the Chalk Hills" or "Private Detective" - implying a variety of related capabilities. Others might represent specific capabilities or assets such as "Lore of the Ancients," "Captain of the Fencing Team," or "The Jade Eye Medallion."

Ultimately, **abilities** are just names for the interesting things your character can do.

### 2.1.2 Ratings and Masteries

*QuestWorlds* **abilities** are **rated** on a range of 1–20, representing the **target number (TN)** you need to roll or less to succeed on your roll during a **contest** (see §2.3 for more details). **Ratings** are also scalable beyond that range using tiers of capability we refer to as **Mastery**. When you raise a **rating** of 20 by one point, either permanently through character advancement or a temporarily with **modifier** to a contest roll, the **rating** increases not to 21, but to 1M.

The "M" after the **rating** signifies **mastery**. You have now reached a new order of excellence in that **ability**, such that your die rolls will almost always succeed. Unless opposed by similarly exalted **resistance** (see §2.3.5.2 for more details) the number in front of the M is now the **target number** you seek to roll or less to achieve a **critical**!

As a **rating** climbs, you may even gain multiple **masteries** in it. **Mastery** tiers above one (representing an overall **rating** or 41 or more) are marked with a number to the right of the M symbol. Each successive **rating** increase over 20 becomes a new **mastery** tier. Thus, if you have 10M2, you have two **masteries** (representing a total **rating** of 50, 10+20+20). 10M3 means that you have three **masteries**, and so on.

Specific *QuestWorlds* games or genre packs may use other symbols relevant to their setting or genre to denote **mastery** instead of M. If so, this should be clearly noted by their designers.

In summary, to reflect abilities (or **resistance**s), higher than 20, you divide the **ability** by 20, noting a **mastery** for each multiple of 20 the **ability** exceeds, and treating the remainder as the **target number**. So, for an **ability** of 27, 27 ÷ 20 = 1 remainder 7, which translates into a **rating** of seven with one **mastery** written as "7M"; while for an **ability** of 43, 43 ÷ 20 = 2 remainder 3, which translates into a **rating** of three with two **masteries**, written as "3M2" on the character sheet.

#### 2.1.2.1 No Relevant **ability**

You may sometimes be faced with a **story obstacle** for which you have no relevant **ability** whatsoever. In such cases, you may still enter into conflict with the **story obstacle** using a minimum base **target number** of 6 for your **contest** roll. Like **ratings**, it may also be subject to **modifiers**.

#### 2.1.2.2 Making Ratings Quantitative

While *QuestWorlds* generally treats **ratings** as abstract measures of problem solving power rather than quantitive measures of in-fiction traits, some games may also depart from this practice in order to more closely couple key fictional elements to the mechanics. For example, a magic system might classify certain supernatural effects as Apprentice, Journeyman, or Master level, and require **ratings** of 15, 5M, or 1M2 (respectively) in a relevant **ability** to even attempt them. 

Such departures from abstraction should generally only be made where the increased complexity they bring leads to rewarding choices in a key area of interest to the setting or genre at hand. In most cases, you and your GM can simply follow the fiction surrounding your **ability** and its context within the setting for guidance as to what applications of the **ability** are credible.

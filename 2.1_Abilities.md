## 2.1 Abilities

Characters in *QuestWorlds* are defined by the **abilities** they use to face the challenges that arise in the course of their story. Rather than having a standard list of attributes, skills, powers, etc. for all characters, anything that you can apply overcome a **story obstacle** or answer a **story question** could be one of your **abilities**. While your GM may provide some example **abilities** to choose from that connect your PC to a particular story or game world (whether created by your GM or by the designer of a particular game), you get to make up and describe most or all of your **abilities**.

Some **abilities** might be broad descriptions of your background or expertise, like "Dwarf of the Chalk Hills" or "Private Detective" - implying a variety of related capabilities. Others might represent specific capabilities or assets such as "Lore of the Ancients," "Captain of the Fencing Team," or "The Jade Eye Medallion."

Ultimately, **abilities** are just names for the interesting things your character can do.

### 2.1.1 Flaws

Your character may have one or more **flaws**. A **flaw** is an **ability** that you do not use to accomplish something, but instead the GM uses to hinder you from accomplishing something, or invokes to force you to act a certain way.

**Flaws** maybe psychological weaknesses such as "Alcoholic" or "Heroin Addict", or physical weaknesses such as "One-Eye," "Wheelchair-Bound" or "Asthmatic." A **flaw** might also be a moral philosophy such as "Code Against Killing," "Pacifist," or "Radical Candor" that limit your behavior in some way. A **flaw** also might be a relationship such as a "Frail Aunt," "Single Dad," or "Blackmailed".

Many **flaws** describe attributes that can be viewed positively. By making it a **flaw** and not an **ability** you are inviting your GM to use it to make your life more difficult, not easier.

You should not use your **flaw** to accomplish something; if you feel that is likely, use an **ability** and flag to your GM when you want them to treat it as a **flaw** at an appropriate moment.

Ultimately, in *QuestWorlds* a **flaw** is simply something that you invite the GM to use to hinder or prevent your character doing something. In return for the GM exercising the **flaw** you gain **experience points** (see §8.1).

In play your PC may work to overcome a **flaw** and you may reach the point that you agree with your GM that story events mean that it is no longer relevant. You can then drop that **flaw** from your character sheet and gain an **experience point**.

You can add a new **flaw** if play suggests one might emerge, with discussion with the GM.

### 2.1.2 Scores, Ratings and Masteries

*QuestWorlds* **abilities** are **scored** on a **rating** of 1–20, representing the **target number (TN)** you need to roll or less to succeed on your roll during a **contest** (see §2.4 for more details).

 Once your **ability** passes 20, you would always be able to roll under it on a D20. So to allow abilities to scale over 20 we use **tiers** of capability we refer to as a **masteries**.  
 
 To reflect abilities (or **resistances**) higher than 20, either permanently through character advancement or a temporarily with **modifier** to a contest roll, we use a **mastery**. We denote an ability above 20 as **TN** + M, for example 7M represents a **TN** of 7 and one **mastery**. We represent abilities above 20M as **TN** + M2, for example 4M2 represents a **TN** of 4 and two **masteries**.

 The progression of **ability** **scores** is thus 1-20, 1M-20M, 1M2-20M2, 1M3-20M3 and so on.

Specific *QuestWorlds* games or genre packs may use other symbols relevant to their setting or genre to denote **mastery** instead of M. If so, this should be clearly noted by their designers.

For how **masteries** work in play, see §2.4.5 for more details on **bumps**.

#### 2.1.2.1 No Relevant **ability**

You may sometimes be faced with a **story obstacle**  or **story question** for which you have no relevant **ability** whatsoever. In such cases, you may still enter into conflict with the **story obstacle** using a minimum base **target number** of 6 for your **contest** roll. Like **scores**, it may also be subject to **modifiers**.

#### 2.1.2.2 Using Scores As thresholds

*QuestWorlds* treats **scores** as a measure of how effective you are at solving problems with the **ability**, and does not limit what you can do with that **ability**, provided your actions are credible in genre. Where an important part of the genre is that certain uses of the **ability** are only available when you pass a threshold of experience, often through overcoming story obstacles to improve the **ability** in game, you may chose to set threshold for those **abilities**. For example, a magic system might classify certain supernatural effects as Apprentice, Journeyman, or Master level, and require **ratings** of 15, 5M, or 1M2 (respectively) in a relevant **ability** to even attempt them.

Such departures from abstraction should generally only be made where the increased complexity they bring leads to rewarding choices in a key area of interest to the setting or genre at hand. In most cases, you and your GM can simply follow the fiction surrounding your **ability** and its context within the setting for guidance as to what applications of the **ability** are credible.

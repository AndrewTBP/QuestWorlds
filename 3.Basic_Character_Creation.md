# 3. Character Creation

The first step in creating your character is to come up with a concept that fits in with the genre of game that your GM intends to run. With that, you can assign **abilities**, ratings for those **abilities**, and if required **flaws**.

In addition, you will want to give your character a name, and provide a physical description. We recommend focusing on three physical things about your PC that others would immediately notice, over anything more detailed.

## 3.1 As-You-Go Method

1. Concept

The concept is a brief phrase, often just a couple of words, that tells the GM and other players what you do and how you act. Start with a noun or phrase indicating your **occupation** or area of expertise, and modify it with an adjective suggesting a **distinguishing characteristic**, a personality trait that defines you in broad strokes:

* haughty priestess
* hotshot lawyer
* naïve warrior
* noble samurai
* remorseful assassin
* sardonic ex-mercenary
* slothful vampire

2. Now provide your character with a name.
3. If the series uses other **keywords**, such as those for culture or religion, you may gain one for free.
4. When events in the story put you in a situation where you want to overcome a **story obstacle**, make up an applicable **ability** on the spot. The first time you use an **ability** (including the two you start play with), assign an **rating** to it. This may be a **breakout ability** from a **keyword**. You are restricted to only one **sidekick**.
5. If you want, describe **flaws**.
6. Once you have 12 **abilities** (including the two for character concept), and up to three **flaws** you are done creating your character.

## 3.2 Assigning Ability Ratings

You have now defined your **abilities**. These tell everyone what you can do. Now assign numbers to each **ability**, called **ratings**, which determine how well you can do these things.

 Assign a starting **rating** of 17 to the **ability** you find most important or defining. Although most players consider it wisest to assign this **rating** to their **occupation**, which is usually a **keyword**, you don’t have to do this. Assign a **rating** of 17 to your **distinguishing characteristic**. In some cases, you may treat your **distinguishing characteristic** as a **breakout ability** from a **keyword** in this case, treat it as a +4.

 All other **abilities** start at a **rating** of 13.

Now spend up to 20 points to boost any of your various **ratings**, including **keywords**. Each point spent increases a **rating** by 1 point. You can’t spend more than 10 points on any one **ability**.

Some genre packs may require you to have additional **keywords** that reflect the setting. These additional **keywords** come from the 12 **ability** allowance, so in many genres you will have fewer wildcard **abilities** but better fit the setting.

## 3.3 Keywords

You may build your PC around one or more **keywords**. A **keyword** gives you a package deal: you get a number of **abilities** by selecting a pre-existing character concept, which the player then modifies.

**Keywords** are best suited for use as the PC’s **occupation**.

In certain genres, you may require multiple **keywords**: for example, one for **occupation**, another for species or culture, and perhaps a third for religious affiliation.

Here are two ways to handle **keywords**. If in doubt, choose Umbrella.

**Keywords as Packages**: Treat **keywords** simply as shorthand for a package of **abilities**. These can be boosted together during character creation, but are too unrelated to increase together during a game. You are still free to use the **keyword** as an **ability**, and in fact may prefer to write only the specific **abilities** they’ve improved on their character sheet.

**Keywords as an Umbrella**: Treat **keywords** both as raisable **abilities** and as a collection of more specific **abilities**. This approach keeps the character sheet from getting too cluttered but encourages specialization. If your character is particulary good at an aspect of that keyword, you create a **breakout ability** under the keyword at a **bonus** from the **rating** of the **keyword** You write these specialized **breakout abilities** under the **keyword**, along with how much they've improved from the **keyword**:

Detective 17
    Forensics +2
    Handgun +1

In this example, whilst the **rating** for most **contests** in which Detective was an appopriate **tactic** would be 17, for contests involving Forensics it would be 19, and for those involving firing a handgun it would be 18.

In some settings, an **ability** may be listed in more than one of a PC’s **keywords**. Choose only one to detail it under.

## 3.3 Flaws

You may assign up to three **flaws** to their PC. Common flaws include:

* Personality traits:surly, petty, compulsive.
* Physical challenges:blindness, lameness, diabetes.
* Social hurdles: outcast, ill-mannered, hated by United supporters.

**Flaws** are assigned a **rating** equivalent to the your **abilities**. The first **flaw** is rated at the highest **ability**, the second shares the same **rating** as the second-highest **ability**, and the third equals the lowest **ability**.

Certain **keywords** include **flaws**. **Flaws** gained through **keywords** do not count against the limit of three chosen  **flaws**. All **flaws** after the third are given the same **rating** as the third **ability**. You may designate **flaws** from **keywords** as your first or second-ranked **flaw**. When **flaws** manifest during play, your GM places you in a **contest** against them, and rolls their associated **ratings** as **resistances** to the your efforts. This method applies to **flaws** that primarily present you with additional **story obstacles** to overcome.

Your GM may decide during play that certain **flaws** are better expressed as **penalties** to your attempts to overcome other **resistances**. Divide the value by 5 and round (a **flaw**S of 19 imposes a –4 **penalty**). This is appropriate where the player specifies that your **ability** to solve problems drops under certain specific conditions. Examples might include:

* Tongue-tied in large gatherings.
* Lousy with a stick shift.
* Can’t stand snakes.

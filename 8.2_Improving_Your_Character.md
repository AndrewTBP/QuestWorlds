## 8.2 Improving Your Character

When you accumulate 10 **experience points**, you can buy an **advance**. An **advance** allows you to select two of the following. You cannot choose an element more than once.

- +9 to a standalone **ability** or breakout **ability**; or +6 to a **keyword**.
- +6 to a standalone **ability** or breakout **ability**; or +3 to a **keyword**.
- a new standalone **ability** at 13; or a new breakout **ability** at + 1.
- a new standalone **ability** at 13.
- Turn a stand-alone **ability** into a **keyword** by adding a new +1 breakout **ability** to it.

In some genres you may wish to maintain a tally of the total **experience points** earned as a measure of your reputation.

### 8.2.1 Catch-Ups

To encourage well-rounded characters, a package deal, called a **catch-up**, becomes available whenever you acquire via improvement a new **mastery** in one of your **abilities** (**keyword** or stand-alone). Any time one of your **scores** crosses a **mastery** threshold (i.e. 20 -> 21, 40 -> 41, etc). you may also improve up to three **abilities** or **keywords** of your choice by three points each, as long as the chosen **abilities** are currently rated five or more points lower than your newly adjusted **scores** in the raised **ability** that triggered the **catch-up**.

You may not increase the bonus of **breakout abilities** under a **keyword** with a **catch-up**, nor does net effective value of a breakout **ability** crossing a **mastery** threshold trigger a **catch-up**. Only a **keyword**'s base **scores** is considered in this context.

### 8.2.2 Directed Improvements

On occasion your GM may increase one of your **abilities**, by +3, +6 or +9, or give you a new **ability**, usually rated at 13. These are called **directed improvements**.

**Directed improvements** are usually rewards for overcoming particularly important or dramatic **story obstacles**.

Your GM will tend to use them to raise **abilities** that would otherwise fall behind, but should increase due to story logic, or introduce new **abilities** for the same reason.

### 8.2.3 Timing of Improvements

Your improvements happen immediately, when you cross the threshold to buy an **advance**, or a GM awards you a **directed improvement**.

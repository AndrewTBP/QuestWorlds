# 6. Relationships

Abilities may represent your relationship to NPCs.

## 6.1 Supporting Characters

Many relationships connect you to NPCs controlled by the GM.

When you try to use one of these relationships to solve a problem, your tactic is your relationship ability. You can’t simply go to the supporting character you have a relationship with, stick them with the problem, and expect to see it solved.

If you succeeds, the supporting character helps you solve the problem. If you fail, they don’t. As with any ability, you must still specify how the NPC goes about overcoming the obstacle. Calls on relationships are almost always simple contests.

In crucial situations, it may seem dramatically inappropriate for you to solve a problem indirectly, by working through others. Your GM can expose the supporting character to serious risk. If the character dies or otherwise suffers a change of status that renders him useless to you, you permanently lose the relationship ability. 

Before putting supporting characters at serious risk, your GM should make sure the players understand the magnitude of the possible consequences.

When supporting characters undertake significant risk, the supporting character may suffer a consequence of defeat commensurate with the level of the defeat in the contest. Or
it may simply be your relationship that is damaged or destroyed.

## 6.2 Allies

An ally is a character of roughly the same level of accomplishment as you, often in the same or a similar line of work. For every favor you ask of them, they’ll ask one of you. These reciprocal favors will be roughly equivalent in terms of risk, time commitment, difficulty, and inconvenience.

## 6.3 Patrons

Patrons enjoy greater access to resources than you, either through personal ownership (as in a Merchant Prince) or authority (as in the governor of a province). They may lend you advice or provide them with resources but are too busy and important to personally perform tasks for you. They may hire you to do jobs, or issue orders within a command structure to which you both belong.  

When a you rolls your Patron relationship, your GM adjusts the difficulty depending on what
the you have done for them lately.

## 6.4 Contacts

A contact is a specialist in an occupation, skill, or area of expertise. Contacts provide your information and perform minor favors, but will expect information or small favors from you in return.

You can describe a contact as being a particular individual, or as a group of similar individuals.

### 6.4.1 Occupational Contacts

Any occupational keyword can be treated as a source of contacts. However, using an occupational keyword as a source of contacts will always be a stretch. To more reliably draw on particular contacts associated with a profession, you should take an explicit ability.

## 6.5 Followers

A follower is a secondary character that travels with you and contributes on a regular basis to your success.

There are two types of followers: sidekicks and retainers.

Followers need not be people, or even sentient beings: you can write up a spirit guardian, trusty robot, or companion animal as a follower.

### 6.5.1 Sidekick

A sidekick is a secondary character under the your control. Most of the time they stays at your side to render assistance, but they can also go off and perform errands or missions on their own. 

You should give their sidekick a name. You should, when asked, explain how the sidekick came to be
the your follower, and why they continues in that role.

Sidekicks start with three abilities, one rated at 16 and the others at 13. Any of these abilities may
be a keyword. At least one of them should indicate a personality trait.

If the sidekick is nonhuman or a member of an unusual culture, one of its three starting abilities
must be its species or culture keyword.

Once you have determined the sidekick’s base abilities, they allocate 15 additional points between three of them, spending no more than 10 on any one ability.

You can improve these abilities through the expenditure of Hero Points.

You may use any of your sidekick’s abilities as your own. The companion can go off and do things without you.

### 6.5.2 Replacing Lost Sidekicks

As a consequence of defeats in which they participated, sidekicks can be killed or leave your
service permanently.

Defeat in physical contests can lead to literal death. Metaphorical deaths from non-violent contests indicate a break you. The sidekick may angrily withdraw from your service, but is more likely to sorrowfully retire. You may be able to bring a sidekick back from metaphorical death by overcoming story obstacles.

If you lose a sidekick, they may create a new one without needing to spend a Hero Point. You
must explain how the new sidekick has come to be your new follower.

You may find it convenient to promote retainers to sidekick status, giving them names and personalities, with a sudden boost in abilities and ratings to match.

### 6.5.3 Retainers

A retainer is a more or less anonymous servant or helper. You may specify a single retainer, or, where appropriate to your character concept, an entire staff of them.

Like any other ability, a retainer ability allows you to overcome relevant obstacles by engaging in a contest. To model the contribution of retainers, when you are acting, you can use them to augment your ability. Your GM can rule that consequences of defeat apply to retainers.

Retainers generally regard you with all the affection and loyalty due to an employer or master. If you treat them more poorly than is expected for their culture, your GM should increase the difficulty level of attempts to make use of their talents.

If you lose retainers for any reason, you can replace them simply by providing a convincing
explanation of how you go about it.

## 6.6 Relationships as Flaws

Certain relationships with supporting characters act as flaws. They impose obligations on you, prompting your GM to present you with obstacles you have no choice but to overcome.

### 6.6.1 Dependents

A dependent is a person, usually a family member or loved one, who requires your aid and protection. Your GM should periodically create storylines in which your dependent is endangered.

Rather than taking a dependent as a flaw, you may find it more fruitful to specify the nature of your relationship as an ability, such as Love for Wife or Love for Son.

### 6.6.2 Adversaries

An adversary is a rival, enemy or other individual who can be relied upon to periodically disrupt your plans.

THe adversary’s goals are probably the opposite of yours, although they could be a bitter rival within the same community, organization, or movement.

To treat an adversary as an ability, rather than a flaw, describe your emotional response to them. Examples: Hates Leonard Crisp, Fears the Electronaut, Sworn Vengeance Against Heimdall. That way, you still inspire your GM to add the plot elements you desire, but can use your antipathy toward the enemy to augment your target numbers against them.

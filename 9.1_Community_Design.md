## 9.1 Community Design

### 9.1.1 Defining Resources

Communities can have a type of **ability** called a **resource** that your GM defines. Your PC can try to draw on their community's **resources** to use them as **abilities**. Your GM should focus on no more than five or so broadly-labeled **resource** types, so that the PCs can care about (and have a chance of successfully managing) all of them.

Most communities have variants of the following **resources**, perhaps with more colorful names:

* Wealth — the **ability** of the community to provide financial help, whether counted primarily in dollars, credits, or cattle
* Diplomacy — the **ability** to extract favors from other communities, while minimizing the cost of its reciprocal obligations
* Morale — the community’s **ability** to believe in its capacity to achieve its goals, and willingness to follow the directives of its leaders

The following abilities might appear, depending on setting:

* Military — its **ability** to defend itself from outside threats, and to aggressively achieve its own aims through force of arms (for settings where communities of the size you’re tracking field their own armed units)
* Magic — the collective **ability** of its people to perform supernatural acts (for fantasy worlds)
* Technology — its access to specialized, rare or secret devices or scientific knowledge not shared by its rivals (for post- apocalyptic or SF worlds)

Similar communities in the genre, should have the same set of **resources**.

### 9.1.2 Specify an interval

Your GM chooses a suitable interval to mark changes in **resources**. For genres bound by the agricultural season, this is usually a season, for a military genre it might be a campaign, for a ship a voyage.

### 9.1.3 Assigning Ability Scores

Your GM distributes the following **scores** between the five abilities: 12W, 9W, 18, 18, and 12. Note that the size of the group doesn’t affect the **scores**.

Your GM may create a questionnaire that asks the players to make choices about the history of their community. They can choose their multiple-choice answers by consensus, majority vote, or take turns. Each question secretly assigns a score to one or more resource types. When you’re done, rank the **resources** in the order of the scores, assigning the high **scores** to the highest questionnaire results and the lowest to the low.

A questionnaire introduces your setting in a punchy, interactive format, and tailors the community to the players’ desires, increasing their investment in it.

### 9.1.4 Resource Notation

Your GM will keep track of **modifiers** to community **resources** with a copy of the following record sheet. They will use a pencil, because the numbers will fluctuate.

Your GM lists the names and **scores** of your chosen **resources** in the first row. Under the total column for each, your GM will list the total current modifier. Under the PC column, your GM lists **bonuses** resulting from PC activities (as opposed to un-cemented **background events**.) When PCs **cement a background benefit**, your GM adds its bonus to the PC column.

When PC activity reduces a **penalty** but does not eliminate it, your GM will alter the entry under the Total column to reflect the reduction, but leave the PC column blank.

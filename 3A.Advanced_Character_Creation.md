## 3.4 Advanced Character Creation

*QuestWorlds* offers two advanced methods of character creation: prose and list.

### 3.4.1 The List Method

This is like the As-You-Go method (see §3.1) but you spend all their points before the game begins. This is possible with the As-You-Go method as well, but the list method allows you to signal what they want the game to be about from the abilities you pick, as opposed to reacting to material once the game begins.

### 3.4.2 The Prose Method

This is the most different method as you write a piece of prose and then pull **abilities** from that. Its intent is to emulate a character description in fiction, and indeed PCs can be built by copying text from a story and then identifying **keywords**. It is the least 'fair' of the character creation options.


## 3.5 List Method

1. Concept

The concept is a brief phrase, often just a couple of words that tells the GM and other players what you do and how you act. When in doubt, start with a noun or phrase indicating your **occupation**, and modify it with an adjective suggesting a **distinguishing characteristic**:

* haughty priestess
* hotshot lawyer
* naïve warrior
* noble samurai
* remorseful assassin
* sardonic ex-mercenary
* slothful vampire

2. Now provide the character with a name.
3. Note their **occupation**, which is usually a **keyword**. You probably already picked this when you came up with your character concept.
4. If the series uses other **keywords**, such as those for culture or religion, you may have one of them for free.
5. Pick 10 additional **abilities**, describing them however the player wants. Only one of these **abilities** may be a **sidekick**.
6. If you want, describe up to 3 **flaws**.

## 3.6 Prose Method

You write a paragraph of text like you would see in a story outline, describing the most essential elements of your character. Include **keywords**, personality traits, important possessions, relationships, and anything else that suggests what you can do and why. The paragraph should be about 100 words long.

Compose the description in complete, grammatical sentences. No lists of **abilities**; no sentence fragments. Your GM may choose to allow sentences like the previous one for emphasis or rhythmic effect, but not simply to squeeze in more cool things you can do.

Once your narrative is finished, convert the description into a set of **abilities**. Mark any **keywords** with double underlines. Mark any other word or phrase that could be an **ability** with a single underline. Then write these **keywords** and **abilities** on your character sheet.

There is no limit to the number of **abilities** you can gain from a single sentence, as long as the sentence is not just a list of **abilities**. If your GM decides a sentence is just a list, they may allow the first two **abilities**, or they may tell the player to rewrite the sentence. Note, however, that you cannot specify more than one **sidekick** in your prose description.

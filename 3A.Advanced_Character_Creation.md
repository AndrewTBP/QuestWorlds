## 3.4 Advanced Character Creation

HeroQuest offers two advanced methods of character creation: prose and list.

## 3.5 List Method

1. Concept

The concept is a brief phrase, often just a couple of words, that tells the GM and other players what you do and how you act. When in doubt, start with a noun or phrase indicating your profession or area of expertise, and modify it with an adjective suggesting a dominant personality trait:

* haughty priestess
* hotshot lawyer
* naiÌˆve warrior
* noble samurai
* remorseful assassin
* sardonic ex-mercenary 
* slothful vampire

2. Now provide the character with a name.
3. Note their main area of expertise, which may be a keyword. You probably already picked this when you came up with your character concept.
4. If the series uses other keywords, such as those for culture or religion, you may have one of them for free.
5. Pick 10 additional abilities, describing them however the player wants. Only one of these abilities may be a Sidekick.
6. If you want, describe up to 3 flaws.

## 3.6 Prose Method

You writes a paragraph of text like you would see in a story outline, describing the most essential elements of your character. Include keywords, personality traits, important possessions, relationships, and anything else that suggests what you can do and why. The paragraph should be about 100 words long. 

Compose the description in complete, grammatical sentences. No lists of abilities; no sentence fragments. Your GM may choose to allow sentences like the previous one for emphasis or rhythmic effect, but not simply to squeeze in more cool things you can do.

Once your narrative is finished, convert the description into a set of abilities. Mark any keywords with double underlines. Mark any other word or phrase that could be an ability with a single underline. Then write these keywords and abilities on your character sheet.

There is no limit to the number of abilities you can gain from a single sentence, as long as the sentence is not just a list of abilities. If your GM decides a sentence is just a list, they may allow the first two abilities, or they may tell the player to rewrite the sentence. Note, however, that you cannot specify more than one sidekick in your prose description.

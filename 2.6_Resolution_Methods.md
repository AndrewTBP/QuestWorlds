## 2.6 Resolution Methods

### 2.6.1 Long Contest

Your GM should resolve most conflicts using the **simple contest** rules. However, every so often, your GM may want to stretch out the resolution, breaking it down into a series of actions.

An advanced rule, **long contests**, lets you zoom-in to task-level in **contests** to focus on your character struggling with a series of tasks in order to overcome the **story obstacle**, such as blow-by-blow exchanges with the king's champion in front of the tower where your father is held hostage, or exposing the lies of a witness in the court room to free a wrongly accused innocent man. Your GM should do this when they want to give you a chance to make your PC shine, by focusing in on how they handle themselves in a difficult situation, and giving them a chance to show their range of abilities.

As a rule of thumb, if you want resolution that moves closer to the task level, a **long contest** may be appropriate.

A sequence of die rolls, between one or more PCs and one or more **supporting characters**, breaks the conflict resolution into a series of actions.

A **long contest** trades speed for detail. For the flow of a story we recommend using **simple contest**s as much as possible. If you come from other roleplaying games that have task based **contests**, we recommend playing only using **simple contests**, until you have mastered the different approach of conflict based **contests**, before introducing **long contests**.

### 2.6.2 Escalating Contests

If your GM chooses either the **scored contests** or **chained contests** form of **long contest** you can use an option called **escalating contests**.

**Escalating contests** allow your GM to switch a **simple contest** to a **long contest**. To do this, simply re-interpret the **simple contest outcome** as the first **round** of a **scored contest** or **chained contest**. For example, in a **contest** of magic at the Thaumaturgical Academy, Billiard, your PC, gains a **marginal victory** over their opponent Crowsky. The GM narrates the **outcome**, but although you get what you agreed, you want Crowsky to be humiliated. Your GM agrees to **escalating contest**, treating the **outcome** as the first **round** of a **scored contest**, and scores 1 **RP** against Crowsky before beginning adjudication with the second **round**.

**Escalating contests** can serve three functions:

* If you take part in a **contest** and after hearing the narrative feel aggrieved that you could not bring more **abilities** to bear, and the GM agrees that it would be interesting to let you shine for a moment, an escalating **contest** helps you bring more **abilities** into the **contest**.
* If you take part in a **contest** but the degree of **success** was not emotionally satisfying, an escalating **contest** gives you another chance to achieve the **outcome** you want.
* If your GM is unsure if a **simple or long contest** is appropriate then they can default to a **simple contest** and switch to **escalating** if required.

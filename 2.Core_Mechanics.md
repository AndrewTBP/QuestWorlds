# 2. Core Mechanics

Stories consist of a series of obstacles, which the heroes must overcome in order to reach their final goal.

A player’s encounter with a plot obstacle presents a conflict which must be resolved, either as a success or a failure. 

Whenever the GM presents an obstacle for for the characters to overcome, the player frames the conflict in terms of what they are trying to accomplish, which of their character's abilities they will use to achieve that goal, and how. Based on that framing and other factors, the GM will asses what resistance the characters will face. The player rolls for the character's ability, and the GM rolls for the resistance. he PCs success or failure, as determined by die rolls, changes the direction of the story, in either a big or small way. The PCs success or failure, as determined by die rolls, changes the direction of the story, in either a big or small way.

## 2.1 Abilities

Anything that a character can use to solve problems or overcome obstacles in a story can be an ability. The player decides how to describe abilities. Some abilities, such as a PC's central area of expertise, can be very broad, entailing a wide variety of related capabilities. Others might be very colorful and specific, granting a PC advantages when entering into a conflict with an opponent using a less directly applicable ability.

### 2.1.2 Ratings and Masteries

Questworld abilities are scored on a range of 1–20, but are scalable. When you raise a rating of 20 by one point, it increases not to 21, but to 1M. The M signifies a game abstraction called a mastery. You have now reached a new order of excellence in that ability.

If a PC enters a contest for which they have no relevant ability whatsoever, their base target number is a 6. Like ability ratings, it may be subject to modifiers.

As you progress, you may gain multiple masteries. Multiple mastery is marked with a number to the right of the M symbol. If you have 10M2, you have two masteries. 10M3 means that you have three masteries, and so on.

In summary, to reflect abilities, or resistances, higher than 20, we divide the ability by 20, using a mastery for each multiple of 20 the ability is, and treating the remainder as the target number. So an ability of 27 translates into 1 remainder 7 or 7M; an ability of 43 translates into 2 remainder 3 or 3M2.

Questworlds genre packs may use symbols relevant to that genre to denote mastery, instead of M.

## 2.2 Hero Points

Each character starts the game with a pool of 3 hero points, and gains more of them at the end of every session. These are a precious resource, as they are used both to boost characters’ contest results, and to improve abilities over the long term. 

## 2.3 Procedure

The player chooses an ability relevant to the conflict at hand, describes exactly what his character is trying to accomplish, and how. The GM may modify these suggested actions to better fit the fictional circumstances, and describes the actions of the characters or forces on the other side of the conflict. 

### 2.3.1 Resolution Methods

The core resolution methods are as follows:

#### 2.3.1.1 Automatic Success

The PC simply succeeds. This may indicate that failure would not be interesting (such as finding an important clue, and the PC has an ability that it is credible could help to uncover that clue), or that failure would make the PC appear to be incompetent at a trivial or simple task for someone with that skill (such as a hunter bringing in the evening meal in a forest filled with game animals).

Use Automaric Success when the PC has a relevant ability. If the PC has no relevant ability, they should find an alternate way to overcome the obstacle.

#### 2.3.1.2 Simple Contest

The player rolls a 20-sided die; the GM does the same. 

The GM compares the two results, and determines success or failure. Armed with this knowledge, they describes the outcome of the conflict, and any consequences to either participant.

If players enter into conflict with one another, each rolls dice, and the GM interprets the results, as usual.

### 2.3.2 Framing the Contest

Contests in HeroQuest are more abstract than resolution methods in most other roleplaying games. They don’t simply tell you how well a PC succeeded at a particular task: they tell you whether or not the PC achieved their goal.

The player(s) taking part in the contest and the GM start by clearly agreeing on 1) what prize is up for grabs and 2) what tactics they’re using to try to get it. This process is called framing the contest.

Naming the prize: GMs start framing the contest by asking the involved player(s) what prize they’re trying to win, or what goal they’re hoping to achieve.

• This may be a literal prize, like a gold cup, a gun, or a briefcase full of money.

• More often the prize is a metaphorical one, like access to a location—a treasure vault or the database servers containing the secret plans.

• In a struggle for resources, the winner gets control of something: a seat in government, a supply of goods, the assistance of an ally.

• In a fight, the prize may be the opponents themselves, who the PCs are fighting to capture or kill. Just as often they’ll be seeking another goal and must incapacitate enemy combatants to get it. In this case, beating the enemy is the tactic, not the prize. For example the prize might be proof of the accused's innocence in a trial by combat, freeing a captive from the villain's lair, or intimidating a group into surrendering.

• The stakes may be defensive in nature, as when the PCs try to stop supporting characters from doing something harmful, like dropping a bomb on a city, or assassinating the king.

#### 2.3.2.1 No Repeat Attempts

A contest represents all of a PCs attempts to overcome an obstacle. If a PC is defeated it means that no matter how many times they tried to solve the problem with their ability, the finally had to give up. THey can try again only if they apply a new ability to the task or the GM agrees that special circumstances exist.

### 2.3.3 Resistance

The GM chooses a Resistance to represent the difficulty of the obstacle.

Resistance numbers are derived from a base number, which is modified according to the resistance class, as per the following table:

### RESISTANCE CLASS TABLE

|Class|Value|
|:-------------:|:-------------:|
|Nearly Impossible|Base +M2|
|Very High|Base +M|
|High|Base +6|
|Moderate|Base|
|Low|Base -6|
|Very Low|Base -M or 6, whichever is lower|
 
By default, the base starts at 14. 

All contests use the base number + resistance class, except for contests to determine augments. Augmenting always faces a Moderate resistance—this is always the unmodified base value

### 2.3.4 Die Rolls

To determine how well a PC uses an ability, roll a 20-sided die (d20). At the same time, the GM rolls for the resistance.

Compare the rolled number with the target number to determine the level of success or failure. 

* Critical: If the die roll is 1 (even when the target number is 1), the PC succeeds so brilliantly that the GM may reward them with an extra, unexpected effect.
* Success: If the die roll is greater than 1 and less than or equal to the target number, the PC succeeds, but there is nothing remarkable about the success.
* Failure: If the die roll is greater than the target number but not 20, the PC fails. Things do not happen as hoped.
* Fumble: If the die roll is 20, the PC fumbles (even when the target number is 20). This is the worst result possible, and the PC will suffer a disturbing or entertaining catastrophe. 

### 2.3.5 Victory or Defeat

The degree of success or failure of the PC and GM’s rolls are compared.

If the PC has a better result than the resistance the PC has a victory and they gain the prize set out when the contest was framed. 

If the PC has a worse result they are defeated and do not gain the prize.

If the PCs both have the same level success or failure, the better roll wins.

if the PC and GMs rolls tie, then it is a standoff.

The GM describes what happens, based on their interpretation of the results.

#### 2.3.5.1 Better Roll

Questworlds supports two options for the 'better roll' the highest roll, or the lowest roll. Some groups prefer lowest roll, some higher. The preference toward 'low is better', is often because because 1 is a critical and 20 a fumble, and toward 'high is better' because the winner has rolled a higher number. Groups wanting higher abilities to win out slightly more often should use higher roll. 

Groups who use higher roll is better may also want to make 1 a Fumble and a critical rolling the Target Number exactly.

#### 2.3.5.1 Confusing Ties

Most tied results are easy to describe—as inconclusive standoffs, in which neither participant gets what they wanted.

In some situations, ties become difficult to visualize. Chief among these are contests with binary outcomes, where only two possible results are conceivable.

The GM can either change the situation on such a tie, introducing a new element that likely renders the original prize irrelevant to both pariticipants, or resolve the ties in favor of the PC. 

#### 2.3.5.2 Bumps

A bump affects the degree of success or failure of the die roll. A bump up improves the result by one step, changing a fumble to a failure, a failure to a success, or a success to a critical. Bump ups come from two sources: masteries and hero points (applied in that order). A bump down reduces the degree of success of your opponent. Bump downs come from one source: masteries.

#### 2.3.5.3 Bump Up with Mastery

If you’re engaged in a contest against a resistance, and you have an ability of 10M versus a resistance of 10, you enjoy an advantage. You get a bump to your die roll from that mastery.

You get one bump up for each level of mastery your PC has greater than your opponent’s. So against a resistance of 14 a PC's ability of 7M is treated as 7 vs. 14 but we bump the result one step in the the favor of the PC; a PC's ability of 3M2 is treated as 3 vs. 14 but we bump the result two steps in the the favor of the the PC.

This reflects the fact that an ability above 20 would always succeed on a D20. Because each mastery represents automatic success (apart from a fumble) on a D20, we roll agains the remainder, and treat the mastery as a bump. So on an ability of 27 is 7M, which means a target number of 7 and bump the result; an ability of 43 means 3M2 or a target number of 3 and bump the result twice.

Opposed masteries cancel out, each contestant reducing their rating by the same number of masteries until only one or neither of them has masteries. A character with two masteries enjoys the same great advantage over one with a single mastery as a character with one mastery has over an opponent with no masteries. If you have an advantage of two or more masteries over an opponent, you can pretty much count on pounding him into the dust.

This allows QuestWorlds to represent large differences in abiilty or resistance.

#### 2.3.5.4 Bump Up with Hero Points

You can spend a hero point to bump up any result by one step. You may only bump your own rolls, not those of PCs or supporting characters—with the exception of sidekicks and retainers, which, as extensions of your characters, you may spend hero points on. You can decide to use a hero point for a bump after the die roll results are calculated (including any bump ups resulting from masteries

## 2.4 Augments

An augment is a bonus a PC gets to their target number as a result of a prior contest. This can be either a contest they took part in, or one performed by someone else, most likely a PC. Unlike the case of a Benefit of Victory, which is a side effect of a contest conducted for another reason, an augment contest is 
conducted for the sole purpose of gaining a bonus.

To grant an augment to a PC in an upcoming contest, you engage in a simple contest against a Moderate resistance. The player frames the contest, making it clear how their PC's action will assist the recipient (who might be themselves, or another PC).

In order to work, an augment attempt must be **entertaining** and **memorable**.

### AUGMENT RESULTS TABLE

|Contest Outcome|Bonus|
|:-------------:|:-------------:|
|Complete Victory|+M|
|Major Victory|+9|
|Minor Victory|+6|
|Marginal Victory|+3|
|Marginal Defeat|0|
|Minor Defeat|+0|
|Major Defeat|+0|
|Complete Defeat|-3|

You get only one chance to receive an augment on any given contest. Failure does not allow other augment attempts.

Augments can, however, combine with other modifiers, including those from benefits of victory and from plot augments.

It is impossible to augment an augment roll.

Augments last for the duration of a single contest, whether simple or extended.

### 2.4.1 Quick Augments

Although some players like the uncertainty of rolling Game Masters may choose to run their game with calculated augments: divide the augmenting ability by 5 and round up.

### 2.4.2 Plot Augments

A plot augment is earned by overcoming a particular plot obstacle created by the Game Master. The magnitude of the plot augment is +3, +6, +9, or +M. The more challenging the plot obstacle, the higher the augment.

## 2.5 Armor and Weapons, Possessions and Equipment

Questworlds models arms and armor like it does everything else: any piece of gear, if sufficiently important to even mention, is treated as an ability the PC uses to solve problems. 

The degree to which a PC can overcome an obstacle with their armor and weapons depends not on any qualities inherent to the objects themselves, but to the points the player has allocated to the ability. 

The difference between types of armor or weapons lies in the types of actions the player can describe, and what the PC can accomplish in unrelated actions and unusual contests. 

Similarly, Questworlds treats your possessions and equipment like it does everything else: as abilities you can use to solve problems, or to augment other abilities, which you then use to solve problems.

Having inappropriate equipment can result in an action being treated as a Stretch.

## 2.6 Wealth

In most settings, wealth is treated as just another ability you use to overcome obstacles. Your ability is not an objective measure of the size of your fortune, but instead indicates how well you solve problems with money and resources.

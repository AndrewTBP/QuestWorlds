# 2. Core Mechanics

Stories consist of a series of obstacles, which you must overcome in order to reach your final goal.

Your GM will present a plot obstacle as a conflict which must be resolved, either as a success or a failure. 

Whenever the GM presents an obstacle for for you to overcome, you should 'frame the conflict' by describing what you are trying to accomplish, and which of your abilities (see below) you want to use to achieve that goal, and how. 

Based on that framing and other factors, your GM will asses what resistance the characters face. 

You roll a twenty-sided dice (D20) against your PC's ability, and your GM rolls a D20 against the resistance. Based on the success or failure of both rolls, your GM narrates the results of your attempt to overcome the obstacle. The direction of the story changes, in either a big or small way.

We encourage your GM to work with your suggestions when narrating the success or failure, but the final decision rests with them.


## 2.1 Abilities

Anything that you can use to solve problems or overcome obstacles in a story can be an ability. You decide how to describe your PC's abilities. An ability is just a name for something you can do. Some abilities, such as your PC's central area of expertise, for example 'Police Officer' or 'Soldier' can be very broad, entailing a wide variety of related capabilities. Others might be specific, such as 'Egyptian Mythology', or 'Sabre Fencing'.

### 2.1.2 Ratings and Masteries

Questworld abilities are scored on a range of 1–20, but are scalable. When you raise a rating of 20 by one point, it increases not to 21, but to 1M. The M signifies a game abstraction called a mastery. You have now reached a new order of excellence in that ability.

If you enter a contest for which you have no relevant ability whatsoever, your base target number is a 6. Like ability ratings, it may be subject to modifiers.

As you progresses, you may gain multiple masteries. Multiple mastery is marked with a number to the right of the M symbol. If you have 10M2, you have two masteries. 10M3 means that you have three masteries, and so on.

In summary, to reflect abilities, or resistances, higher than 20, you divide the ability by 20, using a mastery for each multiple of 20 the ability is, and treating the remainder as the target number. So an ability of 27 translates into 1 remainder 7 or 7M; an ability of 43 translates into 2 remainder 3 or 3M2.

Questworlds genre packs may use symbols relevant to that genre to denote mastery, instead of M.

## 2.2 Hero Points

You start the game with a pool of 3 hero points, and gain more of them at the end of every session. These are a precious resource, as they are used both to boost your contest results, and to improve your abilities over the long term. 

Unspent hero points, on boosting results, or improvement, are lost at the end of the session.

## 2.3 Procedure

You choose an ability relevant to the conflict at hand, describes exactly what you are trying to accomplish, and how. Your GM may modify these suggested actions to better fit the fictional circumstances, and describe the actions of the NPCs or forces on the other side of the conflict.

### 2.3.1 Resolution Methods

The core resolution methods are as follows:

#### 2.3.1.1 Automatic Success

You simply succeed. This may indicate that failure would not be interesting (such as finding an important clue when you have an ability, such as Forensic Science, that it is credible could help to uncover that clue), or that failure would make you appear to be incompetent at a trivial or simple task for someone with that ability (such as a hunter bringing in the evening meal in a forest filled with game animals).

Your GM will use Automaric Success only when you have a relevant ability. If you have no relevant ability, you should find an alternate way to overcome the obstacle.

#### 2.3.1.2 Simple Contest

You rolls a 20-sided die; your GM does the same. 

Your GM compares the two results, and determines success or failure. Armed with this knowledge, they describes the outcome of the conflict, and any consequences to either participant.

If you enter into conflict with one player, you both roll dice, and your GM interprets the results, as usual.

### 2.3.2 Framing the Contest

#### 2.3.2.1 Framing the Contest

You and your GM start by clearly agreeing on: 

* What the obstacle is you are trying to overcome 
* What tactics you are using to and overcome it. 

This process is called 'Framing the Contest'.

Contests in QuestWorlds don’t simply tell you how well you succeeded at a particular task: they tell you whether or not you overcame a story obstacle, which moves the story forward in a new direction.

If you need to break into the vault within the government headquarters and steal the secret codes, that is an obstacle, and the contest resolves that. As part of that obstacle there may be tasks: sneaking past the guards, picking the locks or lowering yourself from the cieling to avoid the pressure sensors. 

In a fight, your obstacle may be the opponents themselves, who you are fighting to capture or kill. Just as often you are seeking another goal and you only want to incapacitate enemy combatants to get it. In this case, beating the enemy is a task, not the obstacle. For example the obstacle might be proof of the accused's innocence in a trial by combat, freeing a captive from the villain's lair, or intimidating a group into surrendering.

Unlike some other role-playing games, a contest in QuestWorlds does not resolve these tasks, it resolves the whole obstacle these tasks are steps in.

Your GM will help frame a contest that overcomes a story obstacle, as opposed to simply achieving a task.

You either choose an ability that represents any 'key moment' in overcoming that obstacle, or a broad ability that lets you overcome the whole obstacle. We call this 'choosing a tactic'. 

Your tactic might describe your using ability that helps you overcome a task within the obstacle:  sneaking past the guards, picking the locks, or lowering yourself from the ceiling. Or, your tactic might describe using a broad ability like 'Ninja' to overcome all those challenges that might form part of the obstacle. Either way, if you succeed at that roll, you overcome the whole obstacle. Or by failing at that roll, you fail to overcome the obstacle, not just fail at one task.

When deciding on your tactic, focus on how your unique abilities could help you overcome the obstacle. This as the 'key moment' where we focus on your PC. It is your turn to shine. 

The GM can narrate the remaining tasks that make sense of the story depending on your success with that roll, or have them occur 'off-stage' for speed. Think of the way TV or Cinema often cuts to the key moment of drama, over showing us the whole heist from beginning to end.

Remember, an obstacle moves the story forward when it is resolved. If it is merely a step toward resolving an obstacle it is a task and not a conflict. Don't create a contest for these. Your GM should be sure to look for the story obstacle when framing a conflict.

An optional rule, extended contests, lets you drill-down when it is important we see you succeeding at a series of tasks in order to overcome the obstacle.

#### 2.3.2.1 No Repeat Attempts

A contest represents all of your attempts to overcome an obstacle. If your lose it means that no matter how many times you tried to solve the problem, you finally had to give up. You can try again only if you use a new tactic to overcome the obstacle.

### 2.3.3 Resistance

Your GM chooses a Resistance to represent the difficulty of the obstacle.

Resistance numbers are derived from a base number, which is modified according to the resistance class, as per the following table:

### RESISTANCE CLASS TABLE

|Class|Value|
|:-------------:|:-------------:|
|Nearly Impossible|Base +M2|
|Very High|Base +M|
|High|Base +6|
|Moderate|Base|
|Low|Base -6|
|Very Low|Base -M or 6, whichever is lower|
 
By default, the base starts at 14. 

All contests use the base number + resistance class, except for contests to determine augments. Augmenting always faces a Moderate resistance—this is always the unmodified base value

### 2.3.4 Die Rolls

To determine how well you use an ability, roll a 20-sided die (d20). At the same time, your GM rolls for the resistance.

Compare your rolled number with the TN to determine the level of success or failure. 

* Critical: If the die roll is 1 (even when the TN is 1), you succeed so brilliantly that your GM may reward them with an extra, unexpected effect.
* Success: If the die roll is greater than 1 and less than or equal to the TN, you succeed, but there is nothing remarkable about the success.
* Failure: If the die roll is greater than the TN but not 20, you fail. Things do not happen as hoped.
* Fumble: If the die roll is 20, you fumble (even when the TN is 20). This is the worst result possible, and you will suffer a disturbing or entertaining catastrophe. 

### 2.3.5 Victory or Defeat

Your degree of success or failure and your GM’s rolls are compared.

If you have a better result than the GM, then you have a victory and you gain the prize set out when the contest was framed. 

If you have a worse result, then you are defeated and do not gain the prize.

If you both have the same level success or failure, the better roll wins.

if your rolls tie, then it is a standoff. 

Your GM describes what happens, based on their interpretation of the results.

#### 2.3.5.1 Better Roll

Questworlds supports two options for the 'better roll': the highest roll, or the lowest roll. Some groups prefer lowest roll, some higher. The preference toward 'low is better', is often because because 1 is a critical and 20 a fumble, and toward 'high is better' because the winner has rolled a higher number. Groups wanting higher abilities to win out slightly more often should use higher roll. 

#### 2.3.5.1 Confusing Ties

Your GM will describe most tied results as inconclusive standoffs, in which neither of you gets what you wanted.

In some situations, ties become difficult to visualize. Chief among these are contests with binary outcomes, where only two possible results are conceivable.

Your GM can either change the situation on such a tie, introducing a new element that likely renders the original prize irrelevant to both pariticipants, or they can resolve the ties in your favor. 

#### 2.3.5.2 Bumps

A bump affects the degree of success or failure of your die roll. A bump up improves your result by one step, changing a fumble to a failure, a failure to a success, or a success to a critical. Bump ups come from two sources: masteries and hero points (applied in that order). A bump down reduces the degree of success of your opponent. Bump downs come from one source: masteries.

#### 2.3.5.3 Bump Up with Mastery

If you’re engaged in a contest against a resistance, and you have an ability of 10M versus a resistance of 10, you enjoy an advantage. You get a bump to your die roll from that mastery.

You get one bump up for each level of mastery your PC has greater than your opponent’s. So against a resistance of 14 a PC's ability of 7M is treated as 7 vs. 14 but we bump the result one step in the the favor of the PC; a PC's ability of 3M2 is treated as 3 vs. 14 but we bump the result two steps in the the favor of the the PC.

This reflects the fact that an ability above 20 would always succeed on a D20. Because each mastery represents automatic success (apart from a fumble) on a D20, you roll against the remainder, and treat the mastery as a bump. So on an ability of 27 is 7M, which means a target number of 7 and bump the result; an ability of 43 means 3M2 or a target number of 3 and bump the result twice.

Opposed masteries cancel out, each contestant reducing their rating by the same number of masteries until only one or neither of them has masteries. If you have two masteries, then you enjoy the same great advantage over an opponent with a single mastery as a someone with one mastery has over an opponent with no masteries. If you have an advantage of two or more masteries over an opponent, you can pretty much count on pounding him into the dust.

This allows QuestWorlds to represent large differences in abiilty or resistance.

#### 2.3.5.4 Bump Up with Hero Points

You can spend a hero point to bump up any result by one step. You may only bump your own rolls, not those of other PCs or supporting characters—with the exception of sidekicks and retainers, which, as extensions of your character, you may spend hero points on. You can decide to use a hero point for a bump after the die roll results are calculated (including any bump ups resulting from masteries

## 2.4 Augments

An augment is a bonus you get to your target number as a result of a prior contest. This can be either a contest you took part in, or one performed by someone else, most likely another PC. Unlike the optional rule 'Benefit of Victory', which is a side effect of a contest conducted for another reason, an augment contest is conducted for the sole purpose of gaining a bonus.

To grant an augment to yourself, or another PC, in an upcoming contest, you engage in a simple contest against a Moderate resistance. You frames the contest, making it clear how your action will assist.

In order to work, an augment attempt must be **entertaining** and **memorable**. Don't just hunt for mechanical advantage, show us more about your PC when you augment, their attitudes, passions, or lesser known abilities. Your GM decides if the augment is justified and can refuse boring and uninspired attempts to augment, where you are just looking for a bonus to your roll and not adding to the story.  

### AUGMENT RESULTS TABLE

|Contest Outcome|Bonus|
|:-------------:|:-------------:|
|Complete Victory|+M|
|Major Victory|+9|
|Minor Victory|+6|
|Marginal Victory|+3|
|Marginal Defeat|0|
|Minor Defeat|+0|
|Major Defeat|+0|
|Complete Defeat|-3|

You get only one chance to receive an augment on any given contest. Failure does not allow other augment attempts.

Augments can, however, combine with other modifiers, including those from benefits of victory and from plot augments.

It is impossible to augment an augment roll.

Augments last for the duration of a single contest, whether simple or extended.

### 2.4.1 Quick Augments

Although you may enjoy the uncertainty of rolling, your GM may choose to run their game with calculated augments: divide the augmenting ability by 5 and round up.

### 2.4.2 Plot Augments

A plot augment is earned when you overcome a particular plot obstacle created by your GM. The magnitude of the plot augment is +3, +6, +9, or +M. The more challenging the plot obstacle, the higher the augment.

## 2.5 Armor and Weapons, Possessions and Equipment

Questworlds models arms and armor like it does everything else: any piece of gear, if sufficiently important to even mention, is treated as an ability you can use to solve a problem. 

The degree to which you can overcome obstacles with your armor and weapons depends not on any qualities inherent to the objects themselves, but to the points you have allocated to your ability. 

The difference between types of armor or weapons lies in the types of actions you can describe, and what you can accomplish in unrelated actions and unusual contests. 

Similarly, Questworlds treats your possessions and equipment like it does everything else: as abilities you can use to solve problems, or to augment other abilities, which you then use to solve problems.

Having inappropriate equipment can result in an action being treated as a Stretch (see below).

## 2.6 Wealth

In most settings, wealth is treated as just another ability you use to overcome obstacles. Your ability is not an objective measure of the size of your fortune, but instead indicates how well you solve problems with money and resources.

## 2.13 Ganging Up

Sometimes you may outnumber your opponent. For a **simple contest** this can be often be handled by having your PC on point, and the other PCs **augmenting** you, breaking the usual rule on multiple **augments** if more than one person should be able to support you. Your GM may only allow as many of you to **augment** as they feel would help, not get in each other's way. For a **group contest, long or simple** if you enjoy a numerical advantage you should separately contest against a reduced **resistance**. Your GM should adjust the **resistance** to reflect your superior numerical advantage.

As above, if in doubt, the GM should think of the **resistance** that would be dramatically appropriate for a one-on-one confrontation and then adjust it with a **penalty** of -3, -6, or -9 depending on how significantly you outnumber them. As above, note that unless your opponent is extraordinarily large, you cannot confront them physically with more than about six people (include **followers**) or socially with about two people (again include **followers**) or people just get in each other's way.

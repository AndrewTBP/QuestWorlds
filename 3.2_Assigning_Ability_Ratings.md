## 3.2 Assigning Ability Ratings

You have now defined your **abilities**. These tell everyone what you can do. Now assign numbers to each **ability**, called **ratings**, which determine how well you can do these things.

 Assign a starting **rating** of 17 to the **ability** you find most important or defining. Although most players consider it wisest to assign this **rating** to their **occupational keyword**, you don’t have to do this. Assign a **rating** of 17 to your **distinguishing characteristic**. In some cases, you may treat your **distinguishing characteristic** as a **breakout ability** from a **keyword** in this case, treat it as a +4.

 All other **abilities** start at a **rating** of 13.

Now spend up to 20 points to increase any of your various **ratings**, including **keywords**. Each point spent increases a **rating** by 1 point. You can’t spend more than 10 points on any one **ability**.

Some genre packs may require you to have additional **keywords** that reflect the setting. These additional **keywords** come from the 12 **abilites** allowance, so in many genres you will have fewer wildcard **abilities** but better fit the setting.

# 4. Simple Contests

**Simple contest**s are the default resolution method for all story obstacles. 

## 4.1 Simple Contest

### 4.1.1 Procedure

1. Your GM frames the contest.
2. You choose a tactic, and figure your PC's **target number** (**TN**) using the **rating** and any **modifiers**. The PCs **TN** is the **rating** of their **ability**, plus or minus **modifiers** the GM may give you. 
3. Your GM determines the **resistance**.  If two PCs contend, your opponent figures their **TN** as described in step 2.
4. Roll a d20 to determine your **success or failure**, then apply any bumps. Your GM does the same for the **resistance**. Compare your rolled number with your **TN** to see how well you succeeded or failed with your **ability**. Remember to apply any bumps from **masteries** or **hero points**.
5. Determine victory or defeat
6. Describe the result based on the story obstacle.

## 4.2 Group Simple Contest

In the **group simple contest**, multiple participants take part in a **simple contest**. Each of you in your group conducts an individual **simple contest** against the GM, and the results for each side are collated to determine the victor.

A Group **simple contest** may pit all of you against a single **resistance**, representing one obstacle.  Alternatively, a group **simple contest** may be a series of paired match-ups between two groups of contestants. If you are forced to participate in more than one **contest**, then you face the standard multiple opponent penalties.

### 4.2.1 Procedure

1. Your GM frames the **contest**.
2. You choose a tactic, and figure your PC's **target number** (**TN**) using the **rating** and any **modifiers**. Your **TN** is the **rating** of their **ability**, plus or minus **modifiers** the GM may give you.
3. Your GM determines the **resistance**.  If two PCs contend, your opponent figures their **TN** as described in step 2.
4. For each of your group, roll a d20 to determine your **success or failure**, then apply any bumps. Your GM does the same for the **resistance**. Compare your rolled number with your **TN** to see how well you succeeded or failed with your **ability**. Remember to apply any bumps from **masteries** or **hero points**.
5. Determine the number of Outcome Points (OPs) scored by the victor in the **contest** from the **group simple **contest**** Results table. On a tie the victory goes to the Better Roll.
6. Sum the OPs gained for each side.
7. The side with the highest number of OPs is the victor in the contest.

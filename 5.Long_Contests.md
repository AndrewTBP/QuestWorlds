# 5. (Advanced) Long Contests

Most conflicts should be resolved simply and quickly, using the **simple contest** rules.

However, every so often, your GM wants to draw out the resolution, breaking it down into a series of smaller actions, increasing the suspense you feel as you wait to see if they **succeed** or **fail**.

Think of the different ways a film director can choose to portray a given moment, depending on how important it is to the story, and how invested they want us to feel in its **outcome**.

For example, there are two ways to shoot a scene in which a thief breaks into the bank to steal the contents of the safe.

The action can be portrayed quickly, cutting to a moment with the thief with their ear pressed against the safe trying to get the tumblers fall into place. Then they sigh with relief, opens the safe, and gets whatever is inside. In this instance, the story is about what happens after the thief gets what’s in the safe, not about what might happen to them if they fails.

Another film might instead choose to make the bank robbery a pivotal turning point in the story, if not its climactic moment. It would spend many scenes building up to the safe-cracking sequence: obtaining the plans of the bank, learning the movements of the guards, crawling through the air conditioning ducts, sliding past the motion sensors and pressure plates, and finally cracking the safe itself. All of these scenes would be **rounds** of a **long contest**.

Remember that *QuestWorlds* uses conflict resolution. If you want to describe how you overcome a sequence of **story obstacles** to overcome the **resistance** then your GM should use a **long contest**, if you just want to move on to the next scene, use a **simple contest**.

Even a movie driven by action and suspense will typically include only a handful of these set-piece sequences. They need the rest of their running times to build up to their big moments, to make us care about the characters, and to give us quiet moments to contrast with the white-knuckle parts.

So pacing may always trump your desire to work through the sequence of events, as your GM may wish to resolve this conflict quickly. This is especially true if only one player is involved.

Your GM may be tempted, to adjudicate every fight with a **long contest**, because fights seem like they should be played out blow-by-blow. They should resist this temptation, as fights are often repetitive trading of blows that can drag when everyone repeats actions from **round** to **round**. Only use **long contests** for fights where the PCs want to do more than slug it out toe-to-toe with their opponents until only one is left standing.

There are three types of **long contest**. Your GM should choose one to use with their campaign: **scored contest**, **extended contest**, or **chained contest**.

## 5.1 Scored Contest

**Scored contests** are longer and more dramatic than **simple contests**. Your GM uses **scored contests** when the **outcome** of the struggle is important, to generate suspense for you, or when your GM want a back-and-forth struggle. It is something you and your GM should visualize and describe. 

A **scored contest** consists of one or more **rounds**, in which you perform actions that are similar to **simple contests**. However, actions and **rounds** do not decide the **outcome** of the whole **contest**, only who gains or loses **resolution points** at that time. In a **scored contest** there is no distinction between aggressor and defender, each **round** represents attempts by both parties to overcome their opponent. Your GM should determine who has the initiative to describe what they are doing for any **exchange**, based on their interpretation of the flow of events. If in doubt your GM should defer to you over your opponent to describe what you do in the **round**, and describe the NPC reacting to that.

### 5.1.1 Procedure

1. Your GM **frames the contest**.
2. You choose a **tactic**, and figure your PC's **target number** (**TN**) using the **rating** of your **ability**, plus or minus **modifiers** the GM may give you.
3. Your GM determines the **resistance**. If two PCs contend, your opponent figures their **TN** as described in step 2.
4. Carry out one or more **rounds**, repeating as necessary.
    1. A **scored contest** unfolds as a series of **simple contests**. At the end of each **simple contest**, the winner scores a number of **resolution points (RPs)** to their tally, which varies between 1 and 5, depending on the **result**. Tied **results** leave the score unchanged.
    2. Your GM decides which opponent has the initiative and describes what they are trying to do to achieve the **prize**, the 'aggressor'. The 'defender' describes how they counter the aggressor's attempt to seize the **prize**. If it is not obvious from the unfolding narrative, your GM should choose your PC as the 'aggressor'.
    3. Conduct a **simple contest** as normal, but once the **outcome** has been determined, it becomes a number of **resolution points** scored by the winning side. 
    4. The number of **resolution points** the winner garners at the end of each **round** depends on the **degree of victory** they scored. They get 1 point for a **marginal victory**, 2 for a **minor victory**, 3 for a **major victory**, and 5 for a **complete victory**.
    5. The first to accumulate a total of 5 points wins; their opponent is knocked out of the **contest** and loses the **prize**.
5. Determine the **scored contest outcome** based on **rising action** or **climax** (below).
6. Determine **benefits of victory** or **consequences of defeat**.
7. Describe the **outcome** based on the **story obstacle**.

Unlike in an **extended contest** (see below), where you usually take part in two **exchanges** with your opponent per **round** (one in which you choose the **AP bid**, and one in which your opponent does), here you and your opponent engage in a single **exchange** per **round** (in which whoever the GM determines has initiative describes an action to seize the **prize** and their opponent how they intend to stop them).

Your **resolution point** score tells you how well you’re doing, relative to your opponent, in the ebb and flow of a fluid, suspenseful conflict. If you’re leading your opponent by 0–4, you’re giving them a thorough pasting. If you’re behind 4–0, you’re on your last legs, while your opponent has had an easy time of it. If you’re tied, you’ve each been getting in some good licks.

In a fight, scoring 1 **RP** might mean that you hit your opponent with a grazing blow, or knocked him into an awkward position.

Scoring 2 **RPs** might mean a palpable hit, most likely with bone-crunching sound effects.

A 3 **RP** hit sends them reeling, and, depending on the realism level of the genre, may be accompanied by a spray of blood.

However, the exact physical harm you’ve dished out to them remains unclear until the **contest's** end. When that happens, the real effects of your various **victories** become suddenly apparent. Perhaps they stagger, merely dazed, up against a wall. Maybe they fall over dead.

In a debate, a 1 **RP** might occasion mild head nodding from spectators, or a frown on your opponent’s face.

2 **RPs** would occasion mild applause from onlookers, or send a flush to your opponent’s face.

On 3 **RPs**, your opponent might be thrown completely off-track, as audience members wince at the force of your devastating verbal jab.

In interpreting the individual **simple contests** within an **scored contest**, your GM is guided by two principles:

1. No consequence is certain until the entire **scored contest** is over.
2. When a character scores points, it can reflect any positive change in fortunes, not just the most obvious one.

### Resource Point Table

||Critical|Success|Failure|Fumble|
|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|
|Critical|1|2|3|5|
|Success|2|1|2|3|
|Failure|3|2|1|2|
|Fumble|5|3|2|n/a|

### 5.1.2 Scored Contest Outcomes

As with all **contests**, if the contest involved a resistance we care about your **outcome**, win or lose, and the GM should feel free to narrate the **outcome** for the **resistance** depending on their interpretation of your **outcome** which may not be symmetrical. For example, if the **benefit of victory** for your PC is **pumped** the GM should feel free to interpret what this means for the resistance: in a melee they might be dead, in a social contest they might be exiled, or they might surrender in the melee or cede ground in a social contest. Your GM should focus on the **prize** that was agreed when determining how to narrate over the outcome for the **resistance**.

In a PC vs. PC contest however, your GM should treat the results as symmetrical when determining the **outcome**.

### 5.1.2.1 Rising Action

**Rising action** refers to all of the many plot events and complications that occur between the beginning and the climax of a story. During this phase of your GM's story, they will use the **rising action** consequence table to assess **outcomes**.

Find the difference between you and your opponent's **resolution point** scores at the **contest**’s conclusion. Your GM then determines your **outcome** by cross-referencing with the following table to find your **benefits of victory** or **consequences of defeat**.

Note, you may suffer a **state of adversity**, even if you win the **prize**.

### RISING ACTION CONTEST TABLE

|Difference Between RPs|Negative Consequences for Loser|Consequences/Benefit for Winner|Victory/Defeat Level|
|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|
|1|Hurt|Hurt|Marginal|
|2|Hurt|Fresh|Marginal|
|3|Impaired|Pumped|Minor|
|4|Impaired|Pumped|Minor|
|5|Injured|Invigorated|Major|
|6|Injured|Invigorated|Major|
|7|Dying|Heroic|Complete|
|8|Dead|Heroic|Complete|
|9|Dead|Heroic|Complete|

### 5.1.2.2 Climax

For the final, climactic confrontation that wraps up your GM's story, you may suffer a **state of adversity**, even if the **outcome** shows that you won the **prize**. This represents that at the **climax** you may triumph, but be laid low by the effort.

First, determine your **outcome** for the **contest** as for rising action, but in addition, if the outcome show that you gained the **prize** your GM now cross-references the **resolution points** scored against you by your opponent on the **climactic state of adversity** table to determine the **state of adversity** you suffered in winning that **victory**. If you lost the **prize** use the **RPs** scored against you to determine your **outcome** as per the **rising action** table above.

### CLIMACTIC STATE OF ADVERSITY TABLE

|Total Resolution Points Scored Against PC|State of Adversity|
|:-------------:|:-------------:|
|0|Unharmed|
|1|Dazed|
|2|Hurt|
|3|Hurt|
|4|Impaired|
|5|Impaired|
|6|Injured|
|7|Injured|
|8|Dying|
|9|Dead|

### 5.1.3 Parting Shot

In the **round** immediately after you take an opponent out of the **contest**, you may attempt to increase the severity of the consequences your opponent suffers by engaging in a **parting shot**. This is an attempt (metaphoric or otherwise) to kick your opponent while he’s down:

• Striking an incapacitated enemy
• Attacking a retreating army
• Attaching one more punitive rider to a legal settlement
• Demanding additional money from a business partner
• Delivering one last humiliating insult

Your GM should not use a **parting shot**.

If you succeed in your **parting shot** roll, you add the result from your roll to the final number of **resolution points** scored against your opponent in the round that removed them from the **contest**.

However, if your opponent succeeds, they take the number of **resolution points** they would, in a standard **round**, score against you, and instead subtracts them from the number of **resolution points** scored against them in the **round** that removed them from the **contest**. If the revised total is now less than 5 **RPs**, they returns to the **contest**, and may re-engage you. Your GM describes this as a dramatic turnaround, in which your overreaching has somehow granted them an advantage allowing them to recover from their previous misfortune. The provisional consequences they suffered now go away, and are treated as a momentary or seeming disadvantage.

The **ability** you use must relate to the consequences the opposition will suffer, but needn’t be the same one you used to win the **contest**. If the loser is a PC they use a suitable **ability** to resist; otherwise the GM rolls a suitable **resistance** value.

Where it makes sense, unengaged PCs may attempt **parting shots** against opponents taken out of the **contest** by someone else. You may not revive your teammates by using your lamest abilities to make **parting shots** on them; this, by definition, does not pass a **credibility test**.

### 5.1.4 Asymmetrical Round

You may choose to briefly suspend your attempt to best your opponent in a **scored contest**, in order to do something else. An instance where you are trying to do something else and your opponent is trying to win the **contest** is called an **asymmetrical round**.

In an **asymmetrical round**, you do not score **RPs** against your opponent if you win the **round**. Instead, you succeed at whatever else you were doing. You still lose **RPs** if you fail. Often you will be using an **ability** other than the one you've been waging the **contest** with, one better suited to the task at hand. This becomes additionally dangerous when the **rating** associated with your substitute **ability** is significantly lower than the one used for the rest of the **contest**.

In addition to secondary objectives, as in the above example, you may engage in **asymmetrical round** to grant **augments** (see above) to yourself or others.

### 5.1.5 Disengaging

You can always abandon a **contest**, but, in addition to failing at the **story obstacle**, you may also suffer negative consequences. In a **contest** where your opponent intends to harm you, you will always suffer negative consequences if you withdraw, unless you successfully disengage.

To disengage, you make an **asymmetrical round**, using the **ability** relevant to the **contest** you’re trying to wriggle out of.

If you fail, your effort is wasted and the score against you increases, as it would have during a normal **round**. If you succeed, they escape the clutches, literal or metaphorical, of your opponent, without further harm from a **contest** during the **rising action**. In a **climactic** scene, however, **RPs** scored during **contests** you disengaged from are still taken into account when determining **consequences**. In the case of a **group contest**, **consequences** against you are determined as soon as you disengage.

## 5.2 Group Scored Contest

**Group scored contests** proceed as a series of **scored contests** between pairs of PC and opponents, interwoven so that they happen nearly simultaneously.

As in a **scored contest** between a single PC and an opponent, only one **simple contest** per pair of adversaries occurs each **round**. Usually the PCs make up one team, and their antagonists the other.

A **group scored contest** continues until one side has no active participants. If you **defeat** your opponent you can pair with a new opponent. The new opponent might be unengaged, but might also be engaged in an existing pairing. When you pair with a new opponent, you begin a new **contest**, even if your opponent is already engaged in a **contest**. Alternatively, if you are unopposed, you may choose to **assist**. Of course, you may be later engaged by an opponent who becomes free yourself.

You may lose some pairings amongst the PCs, but still win if the last participant standing is a PC; otherwise if the last participant belongs to the opposition you lose.

To determine the winning side’s **victory** level, as opposed to individual **outcomes**, if there is only one opponent, use their **consequence of defeat**, otherwise, use the second-worst **consequence** among the defeated opponents.

### 5.2.1 Procedure

1. Your GM **frames the contest**.
2. You choose a **tactic**, and figure your PC's **target number** (**TN**) using the **rating** of your **ability**, plus or minus **modifiers** the GM may give you.
3. The GM determines the **resistance**. If two PCs contend, your opponent figures their **TN** as described in step 2.
4. The PCs to choose their opponents in order of their **TN** where it makes sense. Otherwise your GM will allocate opponents to you dependent on what makes narrative sense.
5. Establish an order of the paired **contests**. There is no significant advantage to going first, but use your group's **TN**s from highest to lowest if no other option presents itself.
6. For each pairing your GM carries out one **round**. Then they repeat by carrying out more **rounds** in order, as necessary. The Group **scored contest** ends as soon as there are no active participants on one side of the conflict. The side with one or more participants left standing wins.
    1. A **scored contest** unfolds as a series of **simple contests**. At the end of each **simple contest**, the winner scores a number of **resolution points (RPs)** to their tally, which varies between 1 and 5, depending on the result. Tied results leave the score unchanged.
    3. Your GM decides which opponent in a pair has the initiative and describes what they are trying to do to achieve the **prize**, the 'aggressor'. The 'defender' describes how they counter the aggressor's attempt to seize the **prize**. If it is not obvious from the unfolding narrative, your GM should choose your PC as a the 'aggressor'.
    4. Conduct a **simple contest** as normal, but once the **outcome** has been determined, it becomes a number of **resolution points** scored by the winning side. 
    5. The number of **resolution points** the winner garners at the end of each **round** depends on the **degree of victory** they scored. They get 1 point for a **marginal victory**, 2 for a **minor victory**, 3 for a **major victory**, and 5 for a **complete victory**. 
    6. The first to accumulate a total of 5 points wins; their opponent is knocked out of the **contest**.
        1. As one of a pair is eliminated from the **group contest**, their victorious opponents may then move on to engage new targets, starting new **contests**, which are then added to the end of the existing sequence.
        2. If participating in multiple pairings, each pairing is the first to 5 points, points already scored do not count. But the accumulated points do count when determining **consequences** in the **climatic** phase.
5. Determine **degree of victory** based on **rising action** or **climax** (above).
6. Determine **benefits of victory** or **consequences of defeat**.
7. Describe the **outcome** based on the **story obstacle**.

### 5.2.2 Group Scored Contest Outcomes

In a **group scored contest** the side that has the last undefeated contestant gains the **prize**.

If the PCs won, determine the group's overall **outcome** by using the second-best **outcome** obtained by the PCs, or if there is only one opponent, the **outcome**. If the PCs lost, determine the group's overall **outcome** by using the second-worst outcome obtained by the PCs, or if there is only one PC, the **outcome**.

*For example, your PC Lieutenant Jackson of the Royal Navy has led a shore-action against a French outpost. Lieutenant Jackson and two other PCs have **victory** **outcomes** at the end of the contest, so the Royal Navy wins the day. To determine how well the Royal Navy has done your GM looks at the three **victorious** **outcomes** for the Royal Navy, a **major victory**, a **minor victory** and a **marginal victory**. The second best outcome is a **minor victory** so your GM declares that the Royal Navy have a **minor victory** and have overrun the French outpost, but gained little else.*

*Later you lead your men in a spirited defense against a French boarding action of your ship. However, the French win the day, with Lieutenant Jackson and the other PCs suffering **defeat** **outcomes** at the end of the **contest**. Looking at your PCs **outcomes** there is a **major defeat**, two **minor defeats** and a **marginal defeat**. The French win the day with a **minor defeat** for your Royal Navy crew.*

To determine individual **consequences** or **benefits**, in **rising action**, even if you engage multiple opponents in a **rising action scored contest**, only use the last opponent you engaged to determine your individual **outcome**. In a climatic contest total the **resolution points** scored against you by all your opponents. If you engage more than one opponent, be sure to add the **resolution points** scored against you by all of them. If you lost, add 1 to your total. Your GM cross-references the total against the **climactic state of adversity** table.

### 5.2.3 Unrelated Actions

If you are not currently enmeshed in a **round**, either after a successful disengagement, or after winning a **round**, you may take actions within the scene that do not directly contribute to the **defeat** of the other side. These **unrelated actions** may grant an **augment** to yourself or to a teammate. You may achieve a secondary story objective. This resembles an **asymmetrical round**, except that; as you are not targeted by any opponents, there is no additional risk.

### 5.2.4 Assists

You may take an **unrelated action** to grant an **assist** to a teammate enmeshed in a **round**. **Assists** are subject to the same restrictions as **augments**: they must be both credible and interesting.

Your first **assist** faces a **moderate resistance**. Each subsequent **assist** attempt to the same beneficiary, steps up by one factor on the table: high, then very high, then **nearly impossible**. The **resistance** escalation occurs even when another PC steps in to make a subsequent **assist**. This escalation allows the occasional dramatic rescue but makes it difficult for players to prolong losing battles to excruciating length. Your GM should make it seem credible by justifying the increasing **resistances** with descriptions of ever-escalating countermeasures on the part of the opposition.

Your GM may adjust the starting **resistance** up or down by one step to account for campaign credibility or other dramatic factors. If an **assist** as proposed seems too improbable or insufficiently useful, your GM should collaborate with you to propose alternate suggestions which would face **moderate resistance**.

The **assist** alters the score against your teammate according to the **outcome** of a **simple contest**

### ASSIST TABLE

|Contest Outcome|Change to Score Against Recipient|
|:-------------:|:-------------:|
|Complete Victory|-4|
|Major Victory|-3|
|Minor Victory|-2|
|Marginal Victory|-1|
|Marginal Defeat|0|
|Minor Defeat|+1|
|Major Defeat|+2|
|Complete Defeat|+3|

Scores can never be reduced below 0.

### 5.2.4 Followers

You may choose to have your **followers** take part in **group scored contests** in one of three ways: as full contestants, as secondary contestants, or as supporters.

**Contestant**: The **follower** takes part in the **contest** as any other PC would. You roll for your **followers** as you would their main characters. However, your **followers** are removed from the **contest** whenever 3 **resolution points** are scored against them in a given **round**. An additional 2 **resolution points** are then scored against them, increasing the severity of any **consequences** they suffer.

**Secondary contestant**: To act as a secondary contestant, your **follower** must have an **ability** relevant to the **contest**. The **follower** sticks by your side, contributing directly to the effort: fighting in a battle, tossing in arguments in a legal dispute, acting as the ship’s navigator, or whatever. Although you describe this, you do not roll for the **follower**. Instead, you may, at any point, shift any number of **resolution points** to a **follower** acting as a secondary contestant. Followers with 3 or more **resource points** lodged against them are removed from the scene. When a **follower** is removed from the scene, an additional 2 **resolution points** are lodged against them, increasing the severity of **consequences** they suffer.

**Supporter**: Your **follower** is present in the scene, but does not directly engage your opponents. Instead they may perform **assists** and other **unrelated actions**.

**Followers** acting in any of these three capacities may be removed from the **contest** by otherwise unengaged opponents. To remove a **follower** from a scene, an opponent engages your **follower** in a **simple contest**. Your GM sets the **resistance**, or if it is another PC's **follower** they determines the relevant **ability** of the **follower** engaging yours. On any failure, your **follower** is taken out of the **contest**. For **consequence** determination purposes, the follower has X+2 **resolution points** lodged against them, where X is the usual number levied by the **resolution point** table.

### 5.2.5 Risky Gambits

During a **scored contest**, you can attempt to force a conflict to an early resolution by making a **risky gambit**. If you win the **round**, you lodge an additional 1 **resolution point** against your opponent. However, if you lose the **round**, your opponent lodges an additional 2 **resolution points** against you.

If both contestants engage in a **risky gambit**, the winner lodges an additional 2 **resolution points** against the loser.

### 5.2.6 Defensive Responses

In a **scored contest**, you can make a **defensive response**, lowering the number of **resolution points** lodged against you in a **round**. If you win the **round**, the number of **resolution points** you lodge against your opponent decreases by 1. If you lose, your opponent lodges 2 fewer **resolution points** against you. The total number of **resolution points** assigned by a **round** is never less than 0; there is no such thing as a negative **resolution point**.

### 5.2.7 Joining Scored Contests in Progress

When you wish to join a **scored contest** in progress, you and your GM should discuss whether you accept the current framing. If so, you can participate. In a **scored contest**, you simply select an opponent and enters into a new **round**. If you want to achieve something other than the goal established during framing, you may instead perform **unrelated actions**, including **assists** and **augments**.

### 5.2.8 Switching Abilities

You may describe an action in a **scored contest** that is not covered by the **ability** that you started the contest with. There are two possibilities here: either you are trying to provide color to your actions in the **round**, without seeking to gain advantage, or you are seeking to gain advantage over your opponent with a novel **tactic**. In the former case, you can continue to use the **ability** you started the contest with, as you should not be penalized for wanting to enhance the contest with colorful or entertaining descriptions. In the latter case you should switch **abilities**, and your GM must decide if the **resistance** changes because of your new **ability**. Your GM is encouraged to reward **tactics** that exploit weaknesses that have been identified in the story so far with a lower **resistance**. Sometimes your GM may respond with a higher **resistance** because your **tactic** looks less likely to succeed due to conditions already established in the story. 

## 5.3 Extended Contest

**Extended contests** are longer and more dramatic than **simple contests**. Your GM uses **extended contests** when the **outcome** of the struggle is important, to generate suspense for the players, or when they want a back-and-forth struggle. It is something you and your GM should visualize and describe.

An **extended contest** consists of one or more **rounds**, in which you perform actions that are similar to **simple contests**. However, actions and **rounds** do not decide the **outcome** of the whole **contest**, only who gains or loses **advantage points (AP)** at that time. You take actions in turn, an **exchange**, losing and gaining the advantage, until either you or your opponent runs out of **advantage points** and is **defeated**.

### 5.3.1 Procedure

1. Your GM **frames the contest**.
2. You choose a **tactic**, and figure your PC's **target number** (**TN**) using the **rating** of your **ability**, plus or minus **modifiers** the GM may give you. Figure your starting **advantage point (AP)** total using the **TN**, including all **modifiers** and **augments**. The **AP** include +20 for each level of **mastery**, and can also be increased by **followers**.
3. The GM determines the **resistance**. The GM opposes the PC with a **resistance**—the harder the task or tougher the opponent, the higher the **resistance**. The GM figures starting **APs** for the **resistance** from the **resistance** **TN**.
4. Carry out one or more **rounds**, repeating as necessary.
    1. Each **round** consists of two **exchanges**: an action and immediate response.
        1. Describe your action towards the desired **prize**, what **ability** you uses, and how much risk you take. “I want to climb straight up to that outcrop, taking chances if needed.” You can specify your **AP bid**; if you do not, your GM determines this based on the amount of risk you are taking. The size of the **bid** mirrors how bold and risky your character’s action is. Extreme or aggressive actions mean a high **AP bid**, and cautious actions require less.
        2. The **ability** used can be varied, but **APs** are always calculated on the first **ability** that you use in a contest. That **ability** must be used in the first **round**.
        3. You gamble a number of your **APs** in an attempt to reduce your opponent’s **AP**, but if you fail the attempt you lose the **AP**.
        4. Roll a die to determine your **degree of victory or defeat**, then apply any **bumps**. Your GM does the same.
        5. Compare the results of the two die rolls on the Extended Contest Table to determine who loses **AP**; only when you have a **critical** can you gain **AP** from your opponent. The **AP bid** is multiplied by this number before applying the results. Thus, if you **bid** 3 **AP** and the result is “Opponent loses 2x **bid**,” the loser loses 3 x 2 = 6 **AP**. Round half points up.
        6. Determine **outcome**. Each contestant’s **AP** total rises or falls during the contest as they gains the upper hand or are driven back. **Exchanges** continue until one contestant reaches 0 **advantage points** or fewer. At that point, the contest is over (even if it is the middle of a **round**). The loser’s final **AP** total determines the **outcome** for the victor.
        7. The GM then hazards a number of **APs** for the **resistance**, in the same way.
5. **Advantage points** are only relevant for the length of a particular **contest**. Your PC does not have any until the next **extended contest** begins, when you calculate them all over again

### EXTENDED CONTEST TABLE

||Critical|Success|Failure|Fumble|
|:------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|
|Critical|Better roll transfers ½x bid, else tie**|Loser transfers 1x bid**|Loser transfers 2x bid**|Loser transfers 3x bid**|
|Success|Loser transfers 1x bid**|Better roll loses ½x bid, else tie|Loser loses 1x bid|Loser loses 2x bid**|
|Failure|Loser transfers 2x bid**|Loser loses 1x bid|Better roll loses ½x bid, else tie|Loser loses 1x bid**|
|Failure|Loser transfers 3x bid**|Loser loses 2x bid|Loser loses 1x bid**| Tie*|
  
* In a **group extended contest**, the GM may declare that both contestants lose 1⁄2x **bid** to indicate that, although their results cancel out with respect to each other, their situation worsens compared to other contestants.
** If the loser has **ability** 6 less than their opponent or worse, do not transfer, loser just loses AP instead.

### 5.3.2 Advantage Points

#### 5.3.2.1  Bidding Advantage Points

 The size of your **AP bid** reflects the risk inherent in your actions. You describe your action and intent, and say how many **APs** you want to **bid**. If you describe an all-out offensive with your sword cutting vicious arcs, you need to bid a lot of **APs**; if you say that you are circling your foe cautiously, a low **bid** is in order. Your GM  will look at the level of risk you are taking, and may suggest that you change your **bid** to better match your actions. If you do not declare a **bid** before rolling the die, your GM will decide how many points are **bid** (using 3 as a default), with riskier actions calling for higher **AP bids**.

#### 5.3.2.3  Followers and Advantage Points

**Followers** can act in different ways during a **contest**, **augmenting** you with their **abilities** or allowing you to use one of your **abilities** as if it were your own. Alternatively, a **follower** with a relevant **ability** or **keyword** can simply add their **APs** to the PC’s at the beginning of the **contest**.

Remember to figure any **modifiers** into your **follower’s** **ability** before adding it to your starting **AP** total.

Neither you nor the GM makes rolls for **followers**. Instead, their actions are subsumed into yours. The **follower’s** relevant **ability** or **keyword** is used solely as a source of **advantage points**.

You can assign your **followers** to someone else, although you may have to succeed at a contest to convince a reluctant follower to go along.

#### 5.3.2.3 Advantage Point Knowledge

Once your opponent has won or lost **APs** during the current contest, you can ask the GM what the opposition's **AP** total is. This is where the element of skill comes in. When choosing how many **APs** to stake, you must weigh the effect they want to gain if you succeed versus the risk you face if the action fails.

### 5.3.3 Extended Contest Outcomes

At the end of the contest the **APs** of the loser determine the **benefits** for the winner or **consequences** for the loser. As with all **contests**, if the contest involved a **resistance**, and not another PC, we care about your **outcome**, win or lose, and the GM should feel free to narrate the **outcome** for the **resistance** depending on their interpretation of your **outcome**, which may not be symmetrical. For example, if the **benefit of victory** for your PC is **pumped** the GM should feel free to interpret what this means for the **resistance**: in a melee they might be dead, in a social contest they might be exiled, or they might surrender in the melee or cede ground in a social contest. Your GM should focus on the **prize** that was agreed when deciding how to narrate the resolution of the contest.

#### EXTENDED CONTEST TABLE

|Final AP Total|Level of Defeat|Consequence for Loser|Benefit for Winner|
|:------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|
|0 to –10 AP|Marginal|Hurt|Fresh|
|–11 to –20 AP|Minor|Impaired|Pumped|
|–21 to –30 AP|Major|Injured|Invigorated|
|–31 or fewer AP|Complete|Dying|Heroic|
  
### 5.3.3 Group Extended Contests

When an **extended contest** involves three or more contestants, it is a **group extended contest**. The conflict is often between two groups; each side wants to knock the other out of the contest by reducing all of its opponents to 0 or fewer **APs**.

Sometimes a contest will be a free-for-all involving three or more groups.

Rounds in a **group extended contest** differ in that the order of resolution is more complicated. At the start of the **round**, you state your action and **AP bid**  and single out one or more opponents. Your GM then determines the order in which the contestants act. Taking surprise, withdrawals, and similar situations into effect, they have three options:

* Contestants can go in order from most daring to least daring **bid**: a reckless **bid** goes before a daring **bid**, as defined in “Bidding Advantage Points” above. Thus, the most heroic actions take precedence, acting in order of decreasing boldness. (In case of a tie, the contestant whose actual **bid** is higher goes first.)

* Contestants can go in order from highest **bid** to lowest: a **bid** of 20 **APs** goes before a **bid** of 5 **APs**. (In case of a tie, the contestant whose **bid** is the most daring goes first.)

* Contestants can go in order from highest to lowest **AP** total. (In case of a tie, the highest or most daring **bid** goes first.)

During a standard **extended contest** an opponent immediately responds to your action with their own, but in a **group extended contest** this is not true—they cannot act (against you or anyone else) until their turn comes. You may want to change your declared action if another character attacks you first, and your GM will normally allow you to do so, usually to return an attack in kind.

The order in which contestants act is also important because a character (whether PC or **resistance** such as an NPC) can be knocked out of the contest before their turn comes. If your chosen opponent is knocked out before your PC acts, the GM decides if you can change your declared action.

You always have the option of delaying and allowing other contestants to act before you. You can jump back into the action at any time during the **round**, although again your GM determines if you can change your stated action.

When all characters still in the contest have completed their action the **round** ends and a new one begins.

#### 5.3.2.5 Group Extended Contest Outcomes

In a **group extended contest** the side that has the last undefeated contestant gains the **prize**.

If the PCs won, determine the group's overall **outcome** by using the second-best **outcome** obtained by the PCs, or if there is only one opponent, the **outcome**. If the PCs lost, determine the group's overall **outcome** by using the second-worst outcome obtained by the PCs, or if there is only one PC, the **outcome**.

*For example, your PC Lieutenant Jackson of the Royal Navy has led a shore-action against a French outpost. Lieutenant Jackson and two other PCs have **victory** **outcomes** at the end of the contest, so the Royal Navy wins the day. To determine how well the Royal Navy has done your GM looks at the three **victorious** **outcomes** for the Royal Navy, a **major victory**, a **minor victory** and a **marginal victory**. The second best outcome is a **minor victory** so your GM declares that the Royal Navy have a **minor victory** and have overrun the French outpost, but gained little else.*

*Later you lead your men in a spirited defense against a French boarding action of your ship. However, the French win the day, with Lieutenant Jackson and the other PCs suffering **defeat** **outcomes** at the end of the **contest**. Looking at your PCs **outcomes** there is a **major defeat**, two **minor defeats** and a **marginal defeat**. The French win the day with a **minor defeat** for your Royal Navy crew.*

To determine individual **consequences** or **benefits**, use the **AP** of last opponent you engaged to determine your individual **outcome**. 

### 5.3.4 Parting Shot

When you **defeat** an opponent in an **extended contest**, you can act again immediately to try to make their **consequences of defeat** more severe. This is called a **parting shot**. You once again **bid** **AP** and use an appropriate **ability** against your opponent. If you succeed, their **AP** will decrease; their **outcome** may or may not change, but they cannot finish the **round** by taking an action against you.

**Parting shots** are risky; if you fail, an **AP** transfer might bring your opponent back into the **contest**. Your stumble can give them an opening that they can exploit in an effort to snatch **victory** from the jaws of **defeat**.

The **consequences of defeat** can remain after a **parting shot**, if the GM chooses. Thus, an opponent might keep a **penalty** from a defeat even if they are handed another chance by their opponent’s failed **parting shot**.

### 5.3.5 Final Action

If your PC falls to 0 or fewer **advantage points** in a standard **extended contest**, you are **defeated**. In a **group extended contest**, however, you can still try a **final action** to stay in the **contest** as long as you are not **dying** (which allows for no actions). A **final action** represents the knack to come back when your opponent turns away to gloat or deal with the other player characters. A character may only attempt one **final action** in any **contest**.

To attempt a **final action**, you must be free from attention by the opposition. You must spend a **hero point**. This does not provide a **bump** up on the roll to come; it is the cost of performing a **final action**. You can use a relevant **ability** in a **simple contest** against the number of **APs** your PC is below 0. Even if you succeed, the original **consequences of defeat** still apply: a **hurt** still takes a –1 to appropriate **abilities** until healed.

If you win the **simple contest**, you rejoin the contest with a positive **AP** total. Your new total is a fraction of your original **AP** total at the outset of the **contest**. If you fail the **simple contest**, your **AP** total drops even further, perhaps worsening your **outcome**.

Your GM should not use a **final action** for the **resistance** (and has no **hero points** which are required for this).

### FINAL ACTION RESULTS TABLE

|Result|AP change|
|:------:|:------:|
|Marginal Victory|Rejoin contest with 1/8 of your starting APs|
|Minor Victory|Rejoin contest with 1/4 of your starting APs|
|Major Victory|Rejoin contest with 1/2 of your starting APs|
|Complete Victory|Rejoin contest with full starting APs|
|Marginal Defeat|Lose APs equal to 1/8 of your starting value|
|Minor Defeat|Lose APs equal to 1/4 of your starting value|
|Major Defeat|Lose APs equal to 1/2 of your starting value|
|Complete Defeat|Lose APs equal to your full starting value|

### 5.3.6 Desperation Stake

You can stake more **advantage points** than you currently have, to a maximum of your starting **AP** total. This allows you to attempt a **desperation stake** even when you are within a single **AP** of **defeat**. Your GM can never stake more **advantage points** than they have.

### 5.3.7 Unrelated Action

If you are unengaged, you can forfeit your action to do something unrelated to the object of the contest. You might want to try to open a door, haul an important piece of equipment out of your saddlebags, heal yourself with magic, or **augment** an **ability**. Depending on the circumstances, you may have to engage in a **simple contest** to find out if you succeed at the **unrelated action**.

## 5.3.8 Asymmetrical Exchange

If you are engaged, you may choose to briefly suspend your attempt to best your opponent in an **extended contest**, in order to do something else. An instance where you are trying to do something else and your opponent is trying to win the **contest** is called an **asymmetrical exchange**.

In an **asymmetrical exchange**, you do not score **APs** against your opponent if you win the **exchange**. Instead, you succeed at whatever else you were doing. You still lose **AP** if you fail. Often you will be using an **ability** other than the one you've been waging the **contest** with, one better suited to the task at hand. This becomes additionally dangerous when the **rating** associated with your substitute **ability** is significantly lower than the one used for the rest of the **contest**.

In addition to secondary objectives, as in the above example, you may engage in **asymmetrical exchange** to grant **augments** (see above) to yourself or others.

### 5.3.9 Switching Abilities

You can usually switch freely from one **ability** to another in the middle of an **extended contest**. It makes sense to do so if you think a different **ability** will yield an advantage. You may need to do an **unrelated action** to switch abilities—for example, when changing weapons or equipment.

Your **AP** total stays the same when you change your **ability**, so it makes sense to start the contest with your best **ability** (appropriate to your goal, of course). If this seems odd, remember that **advantage points** measure advantage—how well the character is doing in the contest at the current moment. They do not measure proficiency; that is what the **target number** is for.

When you switch **abilities**, your **prize** does not change, just the means by which you pursue it.

### 5.3.10 Disengaging

To disengage from an **extended contest** when your opponent is actively trying to keep you in the conflict, take an **unrelated action** to make a **simple contest** roll against the **resistance**. You use an **ability** relevant to your attempt to disengage; the opponent counters with the **resistance** or, if a PC, an appropriate **ability**. If the GM attempts to disengage, they use the **resistance** to do so. These **abilities** may or may not be those used in the main **contest**.

On any **victory**, you are able to leave the **contest**. On any **defeat**, you must remain in the **contest**, and transfer a fraction of your current **APs** to your opponent.

If you withdraw from a **group extended contest** and later decide to rejoin it (or are forced to), you rejoin with the **advantage point** total you had when you left. If you can show how your leaving and returning substantially changes the situation, the GM may restore some of your **AP**—for example, if you leave a street fight to get your **followers** from a nearby tavern. Leaving a **contest** just to pick up a weapon or catch your breath is an **unrelated action**, and does not change your **advantage points**.

### AP TRANSFER FRON FAILED DISENGAGEMENT

|Level Of Defeat|AP transferred|
|:------:|:------:|
|Marginal|1/8 of your current total|
|Minor|1/4 of your current total|
|Major|1/2 of your current total|
|Complete|Your current total - 1|

### 5.3.10 AP Lending

**AP lending** is a common and important option in **extended contests**. You can transfer some or all of your **advantage points** to another PC engaged in a **group extended contest** on your side. With more **advantage points**, they can stay in the **contest** for longer, or make larger **bids** without driving themselves to **defeat**.

You cannot lend **advantage points** to yourself.

If a **follower’s AP** are already included in your **AP** total, the **follower** cannot lend them to you.

Use an **unrelated action** and describe what your character is trying to do to improve the position of the target. For example, your PC might throw them a weapon, jeer at an opponent, or simply shout words of encouragement. Then, state the number of **AP** you are trying to **lend**. (The GM may suggest a higher or lower **bid** based on the action you describe.) This determines the **resistance** you face in a **simple contest**, with **outcomes** as determined below. Beware: PCs trying to aid their comrades in this way risk worsening their friend’s position.

### AP LENDING

|Outcome|AP Transferred|
|:------:|:------:|
|Complete Victory|Target gains the attempted AP; lender does not lose AP|
|Major or Minor Victory|Target gains the attempted AP; lender loses the AP|
|Marginal Victory|Target gains ½ the attempted AP; lender loses ½ the attempted AP|
|Tie|No Effect|
|Marginal Defeat|Target gains nothing; lender loses ½ the attempted AP|
|Minor or Major Defeat|Target gains nothing; lender loses the attempted AP|
|Complete|Target and lender each deduct the attempted AP from their totals|

### 5.3.11 AP Gifting

If you are uninvolved in the contest you can also increase a participant’s **AP** total. You **bid** a number of **APs** which may not exceed your **target number**. The **resistance** is twice the **bid**. The amount transferred depend on the **outcome**.

### AP GIFTING

|Outcome|AP Transferred|
|:------:|:------:|
|Complete Victory|Recipient gains 2x bid|
|Major or Minor Victory|Recipient gains bid|
|Marginal Victory|Recipient gains 1/2 of bid|
|Tie|No Effect|
|Marginal Defeat|Recipient’s opponent gains 1/2 bid|
|Minor or Major Defeat|Recipient’s opponent gains bid|
|Complete|Recipient’s opponent gains 2x bids|

### 5.3.12 Edges and Handicaps

Your GM may want rules to represent opponents who strike rarely but with great effect or who strike often but with little impact per blow. The first quality can be represented with an **edge**; the second, with a **handicap**. **Edges** and **handicaps** are designated using ^ (^5, for example), **handicaps** with a minus sign (–^5). 

**Edges** and **handicaps** affect only the **advantage points bid** in an **extended contest**. Your **edge** is added to your **AP bid** when your opponent must **lose** or **transfer APs**. Your **handicap** is subtracted from your bid when your opponent **loses** or **transfers APs**. A contestant’s **edge** or **handicap** never affects his **AP** when he defends, only when he is attacking.

Most GMs find **edges** and **handicaps** more trouble than they’re worth, and depict these phenomena with description alone. Earlier books made more extensive use of **edges** and **handicaps** to represent the quality of equipment carried by the PCs. For example, your suit for chainmail might be ^4 and your sword ^3. In games where restricted access to equipment is a significant part of the setting and your GM wants to use extended contests it may make sense to use them, otherwise we recommend ignoring them,
  
## 5.4 Chained Contest

**Chained contests** do not defer **consequences** to the end of the **contest**, instead your GM applies the **consequences of defeat** to the loser in the **contest** immediately following a **round**. This leads to a grittier feel to the **contest**, but at the price of a death spiral: once you lose the **consequences of defeat** make it likelier that you will lose again.

To run an **extended contest** your GM runs a **simple contest** as normal, and then applies the **outcome** according to the following table, with the **consequences** taking immediate effect.

You decide if you wish to continue the **chained contest**, and your GM makes a similar determination for the **resistance**. Both you and your GM then express your intent. If your or your GM wishes to continue, play out another **simple contest**.

If you, or your GM, wishes to **disengage**, then on any **victory** you leave the contest, without inflicting consequences on the opposition. If both you and the GM wish to leave the contest, then you both **disengage**, and the contest ends. If any contestant is reduced to a **complete defeat**, the **contest** ends automatically.

**Chained contests** are the simplest form of **long contest**, and you may prefer them for that reason. They also tend to produce the most extreme **outcomes**, as participants tend to continue until **complete defeat**.

**Chained contests** are symmetric, in that they indicate the **outcome** for the loser, and as this is applied in steps, give the GM no freedom to interpret the **outcome** for the loser when narrating.

### CHAINED CONTEST TABLE

|Roll|Critical|Success|Failure|Fumble|
|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|
|Critical|Worse roll is **hurt**. If tied, no effect.|Opponent **hurt**. If already **hurt** in this contest, Injured. If already injured, Dying|Opponent Injured. If already Injured in this contest, Dying|Opponent Dying: player has them at complete mercy. Contest is over.|
|Success|PC is **hurt**. If already **hurt** in this contest, Injured. If already injured, Dying|Worse roll is **hurt**. If tied, no effect|Opponent **hurt**. If already **hurt** in this contest, Injured. If already injured, Dying|Opponent Injured. If already Injured in this contest, Dying|
|Failure|PC is Injured. If already Injured in this contest, Dying|PC is **hurt**. If already **hurt** in contest, Injured. If injured, Dying|Worse roll is **hurt**. If tied, no effect|Opponent **hurt**. If already **hurt** in this contest, Injured. If already injured, Dying|
|Fumble|PC Dying: opponent has him at complete mercy. Contest is over.|PC is Injured. If already Injured in this contest, Dying|PC is **hurt**. If already **hurt** contest, Injured. If already injured, Dying|Both make a mistake. No effect on contest. Side effects at GM's discretion|

### 5.4.1 Group Chained Contest

In a **group chained contest** opponents pair off and fight a series of **chained contest** **rounds** with each other. 

Your GM should determine the order of action, but as all rounds represent actions by both aggressor and defender there is no advantage to be obtained by going first. If there are surplus characters on your side, you may engage an already engaged opponent in a second **contest**; your GM may choose to apply a **penalty** to them as they are already engaged with one opponent. Alternatively you may choose to **augment** an existing player character, reflecting aiding them in their fight instead.

### 5.4.2 Group Chained Contest Outcomes

In a **group chained contest** the side that has the last undefeated contestant gains the **prize**.

If the PCs won, determine the group's overall **outcome** by using the second-best **outcome** obtained by the PCs, or if there is only one opponent, the **outcome**. If the PCs lost, determine the group's overall **outcome** by using the second-worst outcome obtained by the PCs, or if there is only one PC, the **outcome**.

*For example, your PC Lieutenant Jackson of the Royal Navy has led a shore-action against a French outpost. Lieutenant Jackson and two other PCs have **victory** **outcomes** at the end of the contest, so the Royal Navy wins the day. To determine how well the Royal Navy has done your GM looks at the three **victorious** **outcomes** for the Royal Navy, a **major victory**, a **minor victory** and a **marginal victory**. The second best outcome is a **minor victory** so your GM declares that the Royal Navy have a **minor victory** and have overrun the French outpost, but gained little else.*

*Later you lead your men in a spirited defense against a French boarding action of your ship. However, the French win the day, with Lieutenant Jackson and the other PCs suffering **defeat** **outcomes** at the end of the **contest**. Looking at your PCs **outcomes** there is a **major defeat**, two **minor defeats** and a **marginal defeat**. The French win the day with a **minor defeat** for your Royal Navy crew.*

Individual **consequences** or **benefits** will have already been determined by the **chained contest** **outcomes** on each **round**.

### 5.4.3 Followers in a Chained Contest

**Followers** may augment your character in a **chained contest**. 

In addition, if you suffer a defeat in a round of a **chained contest** you may transfer that **outcome** to a follower, but they suffer a **state of adversity** one level worse than you would do, so marginal becomes minor etc., and the **follower** is removed from the **contest**.

## 5.5 No Nesting

Your GM should never “nest” one **long contest** inside another. If a **long contest** is in progress and you want to perform an action your GM should treat it as an **unrelated action**, or disallow it completely during the current **contest**.

## 5.6 Extended vs Scored Contests vs Chained Contests

We recommend that your GM chooses one form of **long contest** only, and sticks to it, within a given campaign of *QuestWorlds*. If in doubt, use a **scored contests** by default.

**Scored contests** have the advantage of speed and simplicity. **Extended contests** have the advantage of each **exchange** allowing both parties to take turns acting, over your GM adjudicating who has the initiative; the bidding system also adds drama. **Chained contests** offer the benefit of grittier exchanges where the **outcomes** of each **round** have impact, as opposed to being 'cosmetic' until the end of the **contest**.

**Scored contests** require more interpretation by your GM, to determine who has the initiative and describe the nature of the next **round**. **Extended contests** drama comes at the cost of increased complexity, and some harder to interpret corner cases. **Chained contests** create a death spiral which can be hard to break out of.

Both **scored contests** and **chained contests** can be used as an **escalating contest**, see §2.8.2

## 5.6 Extremely Long Contests

There’s no particular time scale associated with **contests**. But some **contests** may by their very nature be a drama that can’t be resolved at one point in the narrative. Examples include political campaigns, construction projects, or seductions. These can be resolved by **long contests** where each **round** is conducted at an appropriate moment, rather than sequentially. Your GM will need to keep track of the **resolution or advantage points** and the **resistance**, though this might change as the context changes (a civil war started by the players could impede their castle-building plans). The challenges of each round will vary, and you may use a different **ability** or **augment** in the next exchange.

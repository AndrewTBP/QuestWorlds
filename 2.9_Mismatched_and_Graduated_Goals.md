## 2.9 Mismatched and Graduated Goals

Sometimes, the two sides in a **contest** may have goals that do not directly conflict one another. A huntsman pursues a nurse, who is trying to escape through the forest with two small children. The huntsman wants to capture the nurse. The nurse wants to save the children.

When encountering **mismatched goals**, your GM should determine whether the mismatch is complete, or partial.

In a **complete mismatch**, neither side is at all interested in preventing the otherâ€™s goal. A **complete mismatch** does not end in a **contest**; your GM asks what you are doing, and then describes each participant succeeding at their goals.

In most instances, the **contest** goals are not actually **mismatched**, but **graduated**. You have both a **primary** and a **secondary** goal. In this case, your GM frames the **contest**, identifying which goal is which. It is possible to have **tertiary** goals and so on, but avoid needless sub-division.

On a **victory** you choose as many of the **graduated** goals as you have **ranks**. On a **rank** one **victory** you choose one; on a **rank** two victory you choose two, and so on. Normally, the GM should give the player the choice of which goals they wish to choose. This goes to the heart of character - what is more important to you? 

The nurse has **graduated** goals: escape the huntsman and save the children. On a **rank** one victory she will have to decide between capture and the safety of the children. On a **rank** two victory, she can have both.

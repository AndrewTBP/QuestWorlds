# 7. Hero Points

Hero Points (HP) are a resource that you must carefully allocate. They allow you to heighten your victories and dull your defeats. They are the price you pay to improve your abilities over time.

## 7.1 Gaining Hero Points

You get 3 HPs at the beginning of every session. During the session, all HPs must be spent, either on improving contest results or character improvement. At the end of the session, unspent points are lost.

## 7.2 Improving Your Character

We present two approaches to improvement, your GM will choose one. Improvements happen at the end of a session.

## 7.2.1 Hero Points

You may improve any ability by 1 point per session, at a cost of 1 HP.

It costs 1 HP to raise a single breakout ability under the keyword, or 2 HPs to raise the entire keyword by a point.

You can add a new ability by spending 1 HP; it begins with a rating of 13.

You can add a new breakout ability by spending 1 HP; it begins with a rating of +1 to the keyword it modifies

## 7.2.2 Experience Points

Experience Points (XP) require more bookkeeping but improvements are driven by events in the story.

Instead of receiving 3 HPs at the beginning of a session you receive 1 HP and 2 XPs. Unused HPs still expire at the end of the session, but XPs can accumulate across sessions.

You can use XPs to either cement a Benefit of Victory or add a new ability with a rating of 13. You must spend XPs at the end of a session. HPs cannot be used for improvement.

The cost to cement a Benefit of Victory is 1 XP for Fresh, 2 XPs for Pumped, and 3 XPs for Invigorated. If you want to cement the benefit against a keyword, rather than a stand alone ability, then it costs 2 XPs for Fresh, 4 XPs for Pumped, and 6 XPs for Invigorated. You cannot cement a Heroic Benefit. Once the bonus is cemented the ability is permanently raised by the given amount. You can only spend points to cement the whole Benefit not a part of it. For example, if your PC has is Pumped on their Avenge my Father ability of 3M, you can spend 2 XPs to cement the benefit and make your ability 9M, but you cannot spend 1 XP to increase your ability as though it were Fresh to 6M.

Once your GM rules that a Benefit has expired, you may no longer cement it.

You must provide a story-reason why the experience has led to you learning something that improves your ability. The main reason for this is to prevent you seeking out weak resistances just to improve your PC. Your GM must genuinely feel that this was a moment where we see your hero grow as a result of their experience.

Your GM may decide that the Consequences of Defeat are sufficiently dire that time itself will not erase the penalty. For example, in a sword-fight you might have suffered a permanent injury such as loss of a limb, a relationship may be permanently damaged, your actions might be forgiven but will never be forgotten. To cement a Consequence your GM must give you 1 XP for a Hurt, 2 XP for Impaired, 3 XP for Injured. The penalty should be applied to an ability. Your GM will double the XP reward for penalizing a keyword, 2 XP for a Hurt, 4 XP for Impaired, 6 XP for Injured. For obvious reasons, your GM cannot cement a Dying consequence. In addition, you cannot simply spend the XP to restore the ability that was just damage; there must be a story reason as to why you can now spend XP to improve that ability. For example, you may seek out magical or super-science healing to restore a damaged limb. Alternatively, you may choose to immediately use the XP to cement existing benefits on other abilities that can be justified by the story, trusting to be able to improve the damaged abilities later, or never.

## 7.3 Catch-Ups

A package deal, called a catch-up, applies whenever you acquire a new mastery; up to three abilities or keywords of your choice also increase by 3 points apiece. Only abilities or keywords with values 5 or more points behind your newly adjusted rating in the raised ability qualify for a catch-up.

You can’t raise abilities under a keyword, nor gain a catch-up when the effective value of a breakout ability reaches a mastery (since it’s the keyword, not the abilities under it, which has a rating).

## 7.4 Directed Improvements

On occasion your GM may increase one of your abilities, by +3, +6 or +9, or give you a new ability, usually rated at 13. These are called directed improvements.

Directed improvements are usually rewards for overcoming particularly important or dramatic obstacles. They happen immediately, rather than at session’s end.

Your GM will tend to use them to raise abilities that would otherwise fall behind, but should increase due to story logic, or introduce new abilities for the same reason.

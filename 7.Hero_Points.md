# 7. Hero Points

Hero Points (HP) are a resource that you must carefully allocate. They allow you to heighten your victories and dull your defeats. They are the currency you pay to improve your abilities over time.

## 7.1 Gaining Hero Points

You get 3 HP at the beginning of every session. During the session, all HP must be spent, either on improving contest results or character improvement. At the end of the session, unspent points are lost.

## 7.2 Improving Your Character

We present several approaches to improvement, your GM will choose one that best fits the game at hand. The lists of advancement opptions presented for each approach below represent a basic set of choices. Your GM (or Genre Pack authors) may also expand the lists below with game or setting specific options as appropriate. 

Improvements generally happen at the end of a session, though your GM may in special cases suggest or allow mid-session improvements that are particularly in-keeping with story events.

## 7.2.1 Simple Improvement

In the Simple Improvement model, you spend HP to directly raise your ratings and/or add new abilities.

For one HP, you may do the following:

* Add one to the rating of a stand-alone ability.
* Add a new stand-alone ability with an initial rating of 13.
* Add one to the bonus of a single breakout ability under a keyword.
* Add a new breakout ability to a keyword, with an initial bonus of +1.

There are two other options, which cost two HP:

* Add one to the rating of a keyword.
* Turn a stand-alone ability into a keyword, adding a new breakout ability under it, with an initial bonus of +1.

Any of the above options may only be applied to a given ability once per session.

## 7.2.2 Story Led

Story led improvement requires more bookkeeping but improvements are driven by events in the story.

Unused HP at the end of the session become Experience Points (XP). Unlike HP, you cannot use XP to bump abilities during a session, and can only be spent on improvement. But also, unlike HP, you can accumulate XP across sessions.

You can use XP to either cement a Benefit of Victory or add a fictionally appropriate new ability with a rating of 13. You must spend XP at the end of a session, not during a session. HP cannot be used for improvement during a session.

Cementing a Benefit of Victory moves it from being a temporary benefit that will expire with time, to a permanent change to the character.  Once the bonus is cemented the ability is permanently raised by the given amount. Because the improvement relates to play, we can see your character improve due to events in play.You can only spend points to cement the whole Benefit not a part of it. For example, if your PC has is Pumped on their Avenge my Father ability of 3M, you can spend 2 XP to cement the benefit and make your ability 9M, but you cannot spend 1 XP to increase your ability as though it were Fresh to 6M.

If the Benefit is a modifier to a stand-alone ability, the cost to cement a Benefit of Victory is 1 XP for Fresh, 2 XP for Pumped, and 3 XP for Invigorated. You cannot cement a Heroic Benefit, treat it as Invigorated for the purpose of cementing (a +9 bonus).  Raise your stand-alone ability by the same amount.

If the Benefit is to a keyword, it may be to an existing breakout ability, or the benefit may be to a specific circumstance that you can best translate into a new breakout ability to your keyword. In that case the cost is as above. 

If you want to cement the benefit by increasing a keyword that relates to the Benefit, then it costs 2 XP for Fresh, 4 XP for Pumped, and 6 XP for Invigorated.

You may also decide to develop a stand-alone ability into a keyword by adding the benefit to it as its first breakout. In this case, the cost is 2 XP for Fresh, 3 XP for Pumped, and 4 XP for Invigorated.

Once your GM rules that a Benefit has expired, you may no longer cement it.

You must provide a story-reason why the experience has led to you learning something that improves your ability. The main reason for this is to prevent you seeking out weak resistances just to improve your PC. Your GM must genuinely feel that this was a moment where we see your hero grow as a result of their experience.

## 7.2.3 Challenge Led

Challenge led improvement relates to play, but sacrifices some of the flavor of story led improvement for simpler book-keeping.

You start each session with no HP. Whenever you participate in a contest against resistance rating that meets or exceeds a minimum threshold of  six less than your ability's rating, you have a chance to earn HP. HP are earned for any contest result that is not of Marginal grade, whether Victory or Defeat. You earn 1 HP for a Minor result, 2 HP for a Major result, and 3 HP for a Complete result. 

During a session you can spend those HP as normal.

Unspent HP at the end of the session become XP.

When you accumulate 10 XP, you can buy an advance. An advance allows you to select two of the following. You cannot choose an element more than once.

- [] +9 to a standalone ability or breakout ability; or +6 to a keyword
- [] +6 to a standalone ability or breakout ability; or +3 to a keyword
- [] a new standalone ability at 13; or a new breakout ability at + 1
- [] a new standalone ability at 13
- [] Turn a stand-alone ability into a keyword by adding a new +1 breakout ability to it.

## 7.3 Catch-Ups

To encourage well-rounded characters, a package deal, called a catch-up, becomes available whenever you acquire via improvement a new mastery in one of your abilities (keyword or stand-alone). Any time you one of your ability ratings crosses a mastery threshold (i.e. 20 -> 21, 40 -> 41, etc. ) you may also improve up to three abilities or keywords of your choice increase by three points each, as long as the chosen abilities are currently rated five or more points lower than your newly adjusted rating in the raised ability that triggered the catch-up.

You may not increase the bonus of breakout abilities under a keyword with a catch-up, nor does net effective value of a breakout ability crossing a mastery threshold trigger a catchup. Only a keyword's base rating is considered in this context.

## 7.4 Directed Improvements

On occasion your GM may increase one of your abilities, by +3, +6 or +9, or give you a new ability, usually rated at 13. These are called directed improvements.

Directed improvements are usually rewards for overcoming particularly important or dramatic obstacles. They happen immediately, rather than at sessionâ€™s end.

Your GM will tend to use them to raise abilities that would otherwise fall behind, but should increase due to story logic, or introduce new abilities for the same reason.

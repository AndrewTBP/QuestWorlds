# 7. Hero Points

Hero Points (HP) are a resource that you must carefully allocate. They allow you to heighten your victories and dull your defeats. They are the price you pay to improve your abilities over time.

## 7.1 Gaining Hero Points

You get 3 HPs at the beginning of every session. During the session, all HPs must be spent, either on improving contest results or character improvement. At the end of the session, unspent points are lost.

## 7.2 Improving Your Character

We present two approaches to improvement, your GM will choose one. Improvements happen at the end of a session.

## 7.2.1 Simple Improvement

You may improve any ability by 1 point per session, at a cost of 1 HP.

It costs 1 HP to raise a single breakout ability under the keyword, or 2 HPs to raise the entire keyword or runic affinity by a point.

You can add a new ability by spending 1 HP; it begins with a rating of 13.

You can add a new breakout ability by spending 1 HP; it begins with a rating of +1 to the keyword it modifies

## 7.2.2 Story Led

Story led improvement require more bookkeeping but improvements are driven by events in the story.

Unused HPs at the end of the session become Experience Points (XPs). Unlike HPs, you cannot use XPs to bump abilities during a session, and can only be spent on improvement. But also, unlike HPs, you can accumulate XPs across sessions.

You can use XPs to either cement a Benefit of Victory or add a new ability with a rating of 13. You must spend XPs at the end of a session, not during a session. HPs cannot be used for improvement during a session.

Cementing a Benefit of Victory moves it from being a temporary benefit that will expire with time, to a permanent change to the character.  Once the bonus is cemented the ability is permanently raised by the given amount. Because the improvement relates to play, we can see your character improve due to events in play.You can only spend points to cement the whole Benefit not a part of it. For example, if your PC has is Pumped on their Avenge my Father ability of 3M, you can spend 2 XPs to cement the benefit and make your ability 9M, but you cannot spend 1 XP to increase your ability as though it were Fresh to 6M.

If the Benefit is a modifier to a stand-alone ability, the cost to cement a Benefit of Victory is 1 XP for Fresh, 2 XPs for Pumped, and 3 XPs for Invigorated. You cannot cement a Heroic Benefit, treat it as Invigorated for the purpose of cementing (a +9 bonus).  Raise your stand-alone ability by the same amount.

If the Benefit is to a keyword, it may be to an existing breakout ability, or the benefit may be to a specific circumstance that you can best translate into a new breakout ability to your keyword. In that case the cost is as above.

If you want to cement the benefit by increasing a keyword that relates to the Benefit, then it costs 2 XPs for Fresh, 4 XPs for Pumped, and 6 XPs for Invigorated.

Once your GM rules that a Benefit has expired, you may no longer cement it.

You must provide a story-reason why the experience has led to you learning something that improves your ability. The main reason for this is to prevent you seeking out weak resistances just to improve your PC. Your GM must genuinely feel that this was a moment where we see your hero grow as a result of their experience.

## 7.2.3 Challenge Led

Challenge led improvement relates to play, but sacrifices some of the flavor of story led improvement for simpler book-keeping.

You start each session with no HP. Whenever you participate in a contest, where your ability does not exceed the resistance by more than 6 points, you earn HPs. You earn 1 HP for a Minor result, 2 HP for a Major result, and 3 HP for a Complete result. It does not matter if the outcome is a Victory or a Defeat.

During a session you can spend those HP as normal.

Unspent HP at the end of the session become XP.

When you accumulate 10 XP, you can buy an advance. An advance allows you to select two of the following. You cannot choose an element more than once.

- [] +9 to a standalone ability or breakout ability; or +6 to a keyword
- [] +6 to a standalone ability or breakout ability; or +3 to a keyword
- [] a new standalone ability at 13; or a new breakout ability at + 1
- [] a new standalone ability at 13

## 7.3 Catch-Ups

A package deal, called a catch-up, applies whenever you acquire a new mastery; up to three abilities or keywords of your choice also increase by 3 points apiece. Only abilities or keywords with values 5 or more points behind your newly adjusted rating in the raised ability qualify for a catch-up.

You can’t raise abilities under a keyword, nor gain a catch-up when the effective value of a breakout ability reaches a mastery (since it’s the keyword, not the abilities under it, which has a rating).

## 7.4 Directed Improvements

On occasion your GM may increase one of your abilities, by +3, +6 or +9, or give you a new ability, usually rated at 13. These are called directed improvements.

Directed improvements are usually rewards for overcoming particularly important or dramatic obstacles. They happen immediately, rather than at session’s end.

Your GM will tend to use them to raise abilities that would otherwise fall behind, but should increase due to story logic, or introduce new abilities for the same reason.
